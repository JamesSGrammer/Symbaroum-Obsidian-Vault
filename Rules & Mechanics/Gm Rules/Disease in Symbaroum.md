**In The World of Symbaroum**, there are many sources of infection which can make people sick or give rise to devastating epidemics. Here follows guidelines on how to make diseases a challenging part of everyday life.

## EXPOSURE
When exposed to a contagion, irrespective of source, a *Strong* test is made; if it fails, the player character has been infected. The vigor of the disease (Weak, Moderate, or Strong) has no effect on the risk of being infected but is of course important for the course of the disease.

## COURSE
Diseases affect the attribute *Strong*, instead of Toughness, and they develop over days rather than turns. The effect of the disease depends on its vigor (see below), but what all have in common is that the sick individual must pass one or more *Strong* tests each day, or get worse.

What it takes to beat the sickness is also described below. If this happens, the recovering individual regains his or her lost strength at a pace of one point per day. If an individual’s *Strong* should ever reach 0, the sickly person dies – meaning that you can actually die from any disease, regardless of its vigor.

**Weak disease:** The infected rolls one *Strong* test each day; a failure means that the *Strong* value is temporarily reduced by one point. The disease is over and the infected starts to recover as soon as one day has passed without the *Strong* value being decreased.

**Moderate disease:** The infected rolls two *Strong* tests each day; each failure means that the *Strong* value is temporarily reduced by one point. The disease is over and the infected starts to recover as soon as two days have passed without the *Strong* value being decreased, after each other or at an interval.

**Strong disease:** Each day the *Strong* value of the infected is temporarily reduced by one point; moreover, the infected must also pass a *Strong* test to avoid temporarily losing yet another point in *Strong*. The disease is over and the infected starts to recover as soon as two days in a row have passed without the *Strong* value being decreased by more than one point.

## TRANSMISSION AND CARE
All who tend or in other ways come in contact with a sick person are at risk of being infected and must pass a *Strong* test as described above. However, those who have the *Medicus* ability may roll twice to avoid being infected, and may roll against *Cunning* instead of *Strong*.

Treatment of the sick in both Ambria and Davokar can be given by different people in different ways, as described below. Note that the various types of treatment can be combined – anyone offered care, medicine, or mystical healing receives the benefits of them all before rolling their *Strong* tests.

**Care:** A person with the *Medicus* ability may roll a *Cunning* test to provide qualified care, which means that the patient may re-roll one *Strong* test each day. A novice can provide care for one patient at a time, an adept can care for three patients, and a master medicus can care for up to ten patients simultaneously.

**Medicine:** A person skilled in *Alchemy* may use the ability in order to concoct medicine for a specific disease. The number of doses crafted is decided based on the vigor of the disease and the level in *Alchemy* (see Table 7). The effect of the medicine is that the patient may re-roll one *Strong* test per day.

**Healing:** Mystical healing works as a bonus for one of the daily *Strong* tests; the attribute value is increased by a bonus corresponding to the number of *Toughness* points which would have been healed. Mystical powers may only assist in one roll per day and have no effect on any temporarily lost *Strong* points as long as the sickness is ongoing. Once the sickness is over, healing powers heal lost *Strong* points as if they were *Toughness*.

## NOTORIOUS DISEASES
The following diseases are widely talked about, and to a varying degree feared, in Ambria and Davokar:

**Weak:** Pale Soot, Bowel Reef, Swamp Whirl  
**Moderate:** Bloody Flux, Stain Fever, Gut Plug  
**Strong:** Ink Soot, Lung Fall, Belly Rot
