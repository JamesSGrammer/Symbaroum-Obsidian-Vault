Tradition: Sorcery
By performing this ritual, and making a successful [Resolute←Resolute] test, the mystic can possess a creature’s body and control it completely for a limited time (up to 24 hours). The ritual requires a link to the victim for the mystic to even be able to attempt the possession: a lock of hair, a splash of blood or an item that is important to the intended victim. The victim recalls everything that happens during the possession, but sees these events more as a surreal dream than an actual memory. The victim cannot be made to commit suicide while possessed, but can otherwise be made to go against all its principles.
The possession can be observed as a change in the Shadow, as the victim gains the Shadow of the mystic. The possession can be broken by either Exorcism or Break Link. If done by using Exorcism, the mystic cannot possess the same creature ever again.
The mystic’s own body remains in a trance during the possession. If the borrowed body is killed during the possession then the mystic’s mind and spirit are thrown back into its own body. The same happens if the mystic’s body is harmed or exposed to some kind of powerful interference (like being shoved, drenched in water or affected by heat and smoke, etc.).
