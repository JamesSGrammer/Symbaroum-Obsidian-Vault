When the characters are trying to escape anyone or anything hunting them, it is suggested that the Game Master handles it based on the attribute *[[Quick]]*. If the characters decide to stick together, he or she with the lowest value in *[[Quick]]* must make a test, modified by the *[[Quick]]* of the fastest hunter. Should they split up, all of them need to make a test, again modified by the *[[Quick]]* of the fastest hunter. And if it is the other way around, if the characters are on the hunt, the same formula is used but instead with a modification based on the slowest prey.
During the hunt, one test is made each turn â€“ if the prey succeeds it pulls away one step, if the prey fails the hunter comes one step closer. To finally get away, the hunted must reach an advantage of 3, in other words, he or she must succeed at three rolls more than he or she fails. And the prey who fails at three rolls more than he or she succeeds will of course get caught.
