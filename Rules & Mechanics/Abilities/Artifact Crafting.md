**Only available to Artifact Crafters** 
The glory days of artifact crafting seem to have passed and the powerful secrets of the old rune smiths are lost. However, even in the shadow of the growing corruption, the creative arts still linger on, if in a more modest way. The character is trained in the art of artifact crafting and can create artifacts of the lower order. Higher artifacts can nowadays only be found while excavating Symbaroumâ€™s ruins, but artifact crafters belong to a tradition that still holds its head high, in spite of shadows and darkness.
The character is also knowledgeable about legendary artifacts and can discern how artifacts work. Artifact Crafting corresponds to the ability Loremaster when analyzing artifacts, but it does not affect the use of them.
The artifacts are described in detail in the Equipment chapter, page 123-127
