**Tradition**: Wizardry
The mystic can break any current mystical links and bonds to an object or a person by trapping the target in a circle of mystical runes and making a successful Resolute test. The magic of the object is not affected but the target can no longer be reached with rituals like HereticÂ´s Trail and Summoning. In addition, any mystical bonds that may have been created by people visiting the location are negated, which can be used to prevent others from using Clairvoyance and Seven-league Stride to view or reach the location until they have visited the location again. Finally, Break Link can be used to cut the bond between a creature and a mystical artifact (see more on artifacts on page 186)
