AS previously stated, Thistle Hold will probably be the place from which the player characters embark on their expeditions and to where they (hopefully) return. But never forget that the Hold makes an interesting setting on its own! The town of Mayor Nightpitch is teeming with conspiracies, secrets and interesting individuals, just waiting to be addressed by the player characters.
