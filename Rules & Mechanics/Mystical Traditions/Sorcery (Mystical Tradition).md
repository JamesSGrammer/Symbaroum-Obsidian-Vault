The legends are teeming with sorcerers: mystics who draw their power from musty wellsprings or gain their corrupt gifts from creatures of evil. It is harder to find them in the real world, but those who know how to read the Shadows can sense their presence or see traces of their tainted work. Korinthia’s people faced the undead servants of the Dark Lords during The Great War, and while the Dark Lords perished, their parasitic powers continued to drain the life out of Alberetor, forcing the Ambrians to flee north. There they instead faced the blighted creatures of Davokar, born from another kind of evil that festers in the fallen ruins of Symbaroum.
	Sorcery is the mystical tradition that comprises powers and rituals fueled by
Corruption and taint, whose usage provides power in the short run, but corrodes the mystic’s body and soul in the long run. Theurgs active among the Twilight Friars gather rituals of sorcery as well as blight-stricken artifacts in an attempt to understand this new, dark enemy. Within their monastery in the Titans, it is said that the Black Cloaks hide dark vaults oozing with corruptive energies and echoing with the lamentations of the poor, tainted souls kept there for study.

### Corruption
In the view of the sorcerer the world is dying or already dead, and Corruption is but one of many symptoms of its irredeemable state. To fight Corruption is like pretending that death does not exist. Better to know it, and learn how to understand and use it as much as possible before everything meets its fated end. 
	To walk side by side with darkness is a precarious act of balance, to say the least.
Not to give in to darkness is the key, for doing so would surely mean being completely devoured. Wise sorcerers accept Corruption, and exploit it, while still keeping a distance from its cold embrace, for as long as they possibly can
