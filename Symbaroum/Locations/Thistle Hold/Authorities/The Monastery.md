The Twilight Friars have a substantial posting in the Hold, even if not as large-scale as the convent school in Yndaros or the monastery in the Titans. In the windowless stone building Prior Emundi and seven Black Cloaks live their ascetic lives. They are active from sunup to sundown and are said to spend most of the time meditating and praying, and a smaller part of each day engaged in activities meant to ennoble the physical shape that the Sun God has endowed them with. On the few occasions when the monks are seen leaving the monastery they are always going to or from the sun temple, presumably tasked to care for its blight-stricken prisoners. Aside from the permanent residents, the second floor of the building sometimes houses pilgrims headed for the sun temple on Karvosti. Then there is the third floor, accessible only to The Whip of Prios – the section within the order dedicated to tracking down and handling heretics. Other than that, Prior Emundi does not receive any visitors, except under extraordinary circumstances. He who knocks on the door is greeted by the young postulant Adso, who is yet to be consecrated and who has to put up with running errands and being the order’s public face. He can talk to the Prior and, if the situation appears serious enough, arrange an audience inside the monastery. However, he who has reason to suspect himself to be even the slightest bit blight-touched is advised to avoid such a meeting.
