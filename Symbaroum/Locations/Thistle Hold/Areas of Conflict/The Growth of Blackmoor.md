Blackmoor is growing. It was once a small camp site but now the tents are spread far and wide over the dark soil, and can during the summers accommodate more people than the Hold itself. The land is owned by the House Erebus, headed by baron Grafoldo who welcomes the transformation. His family earns a great deal on rents and taxes from the stores, guest houses, artisans and eateries that make out a small village core by the highroad. The earnings are in fact so good that the baron has hired a guard – the mercenary outfit called the Blood Robes – to keep some kind of order in the camp. He has also sent a petition to the Queen, asking her to allow for permanent homes to be built on the land.
Grafoldo Erebus and the most prominent entrepreneurs in Blackmoor work hard to get the petition approved, but they are struggling against the wind. Among the opponents are Lasifor Nightpitch in alliance with the House Argona, but also lots of merchants who have reasons for wanting the trade in loot and artifacts to be conducted in the con trolled environment of the Hold. On their side they really only have the Sun Church, partly because the priests regard Blackmoor as a breeding ground for depravity, partly because they want to punish Mayor Nightpitch for housing a barbarian witch and the heretic Sarvola.
