The attack deals no normal damage. Instead, the damage value determines whether the attack manages to pierce the victimâ€™s Armor. If the armor value is equal to or higher than the damage value, the attack fails; if the armor value is lower, the victim suffers an effect such as poison or corruption, depending on what other traits the creature has.
