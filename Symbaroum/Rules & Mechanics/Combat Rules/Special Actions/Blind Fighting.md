To fight blinded is hard, and the same goes for fighting under bad lighting conditions such as in darkness, smoke or thick fog. If both parties in a battle are affected, then no adjustments are needed. Otherwise, the affected party gets two chances to fail its success tests â€“ if the character is affected, the player rolls twice and picks the worst result; if only the enemy is affected the player rolls twice and picks the best result.
