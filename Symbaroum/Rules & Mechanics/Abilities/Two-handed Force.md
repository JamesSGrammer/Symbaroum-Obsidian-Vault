The knights of Ambria as well as the Wrathguards of Karvosti dress themselves in steel from head to toe and have realized that with that much armor, they are free to focus on dealing massive amounts of damage. Heavy two-handed weapons rest comfortably in the character’s callused hands and can have an astoundingly destructive effect on all sorts of targets. Heavy weapons are extra effective against heavily armored enemies

---
- Novice **Passive**. The damage dealt by heavy weapons is increased to 1D12.
- Adept **Reaction**. The character has mastered the use of its weapon, so when an attack misses a target the character may instead use the returning swing in an attempt to hit the target again. The character makes a new attack roll, which deals 1D8 damage if it hits.
- Master **Active**. A heavy weapon in the hands of a master is truly a tool of armor-crushing destruction. When the attacks of a master hit the target, they completely ignore the target’s Armor.
