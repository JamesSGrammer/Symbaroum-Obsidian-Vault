Using weapons like bolas, nets or the long whip, many fighters and hunters of barbarian origin learn to limit the movement of enemies or prey. This skill is also known among Ambrians; flail weapons are, for instance, used in the lengthy show-fights at the gladiatorial arenas and by many bounty hunters. Abducted humans can sometimes be seen wield ing chain staffs, making it possible to ensnare the enemy. The character is trained in the ensnaring techniques used to gain Advantage in melee or to capture prey alive.
