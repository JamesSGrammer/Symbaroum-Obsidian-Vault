**Tradition**: Blessing

With a successful Resolute test the mystic can perform a ritual to contemplate the innermost motivations of another individual and gain a clear insight into that person's deepest desires. The ritual requires a mystical link to the target: a tuft of hair, a pool o blood, or some cherished personal possession. If the test succeeds, the Game Master must truthfully, but in abstract terms, describe what the person wants more than anything in the world. For example: love, power, pleasure, justice, and so forth.
