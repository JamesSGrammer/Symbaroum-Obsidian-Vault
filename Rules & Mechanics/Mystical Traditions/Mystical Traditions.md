The mystical traditions answer questions regarding how these powers are to be understood, how they may be taught as well as in what ways they are meant to be used. They have also worked out ways to avoid or at least lessen the dark side-effects of casting mystical powers and rituals. The powers not only manipulate but also violate the fabric of the world, something which makes the world strike back â€“ in the form of Corruption. That effect can be reduced with the help of the traditions. Player characters need not belong to or practice any of the traditions to be able to use mystical powers. Mystics without connections to a tradition are often called Untamed and are considered dangerous by their traditionally trained colleagues. Schooled mystics sometimes perceive the independent ones as no better than sorcerers, but mostly regard them as their less fortunate and less successful cousins.
