Permanent Corruption means a lasting alteration of the character’s essence and inner being. When permanent Corruption reaches the character’s Corruption Threshold, which is half its *[[Resolute]]* value rounded up, the character counts as Blight-marked and receives a permanent Stigma (see Table 24). The Stigma disappears if the permanent Corruption is reduced to below the Corruption Threshold again.
The character turns into an abomination if its Total Corruption (temporary+permanent) reaches or exceeds its *[[Resolute]]* value. Then the character cannot be saved in any way.

### Permanent Corruption is suffered when:
- Binding an artifact to oneself to be able to use its powers: 1 Corruption (or Experience). 
- Learning a mystic power or ritual: 1 permanent Corruption. 
- A character’s Total Corruption reaches the character’s Corruption Threshold during a scene: 1D4 permanent Corruption.
