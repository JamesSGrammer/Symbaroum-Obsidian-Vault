**Tradition**: Troll Singing 
**Material**: None, but the mystic must sing out loud
There is power in the heroic hymns of old. The mystic can sing while fighting, thereby filling his or her allies with courage and vigor. The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost by taking damage [Resolute â€“Damage].
