The monster possesses a remarkable vitality, possibly born out of a strong link to the forces of nature, or maybe stemming from a bottomless source of corruption. The creature’s Toughness is higher than its Strong value would suggest, but its Pain Threshold is unaffected (based on Strong/2, as usual).
