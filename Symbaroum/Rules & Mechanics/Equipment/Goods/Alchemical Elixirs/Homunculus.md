A seed is planted and one day later a miniature servant sprouts from the ground. The homunculus is small as a child, has no abilities and all attribute values are 5 (+5). It serves its maker loyally then withers away after a month; all it leaves behind is a pile of dirt. Creating a homunculus is a true violation of the natural order, meaning that the one using the seed suffers 1d6 temporary corruption.
