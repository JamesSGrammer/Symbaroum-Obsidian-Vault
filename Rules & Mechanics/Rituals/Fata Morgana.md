**Tradition**: Only available to Illusionist 
The higher level of the ritual [[False Terrain]] gives the Illusionist such power over the lie that it touches the truth; that which is created with Fata Morgana actually exists, at least during the moon cycle that the illusion persists. The mystic can place a type of terrain over another or decide to raise a smaller building, such as a croft or a stone fort (see Damage on Buildings, page 106), on a select location. The creation cannot be seen-through but it can be destroyed; if the rules for Damage on Buildings are used, the Fata Morgana has half the Toughness of a corresponding building. After one month, the illusion fades away over the course of a night. Those who were inside during the night end up on the ground and nothing of the lie remains. Performing the ritual costs one Experience point.
