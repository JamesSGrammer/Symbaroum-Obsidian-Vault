Kos is a trader operating out of Thistle Hold. He is a rather lanky man of above average height and dark brown hair.
Often bringing goods to logging, hunting, and trapper camps. Along with the occasional outpost or village that is springing up not far from Thistle Hold.

Is a good natured light hearted man that seems to take great joy in berating his donkey for being such a slow stubborn (The animal never seems to fail to bray or blow air back at the man)
