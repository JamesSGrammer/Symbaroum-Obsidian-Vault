The weapon is heavy or unbalanced in a way which makes it more difficult to swing and control during combat. An attack with the weapon requires a full turn; both the combat action and movement action are spent on the attack. In other words, the wielder cannot both attack and move during a single turn, but once he or she is in place it is possible to make an attack every turn.
