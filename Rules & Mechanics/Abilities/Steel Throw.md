There are traditions and groups whose representatives have practiced the art of the thrown weapon for generations. Throwing knives are for instance common among thieves and thugs in the cities, and in the woods many clan warriors are equipped with throwing axes or spears. In fact, most barbarian fighters (especially those within the clan of Zarek) regularly use throwing weapons as part of their combat tactics, unleashing a shower of steel just before they charge into the fray.

---
- Novice **Passive**. The character has begun to understand the riddle of steel-throwing. The damage dealt by throwing weapons is increased to 1D8.
- Adept **Active**. The character can perform a double throw with one Action. The attacks are rolled separately and are either aimed at the same target, or at two different ones. The character can also use melee weapons as throwing weapons, but can only throw one such weapon per Action. The damage for this kind of attack is the base damage of the melee weapon, including any passive abilities that the thrower might have.
- Master **Active**. The character can unleash a devastating triple throw and send three throwing weapons towards his or her enemies, all of them against a single target or distributed among multiple ones.
