Elda of clan Godinja has with her bone pale hair and blue-toned skin always felt like an outsider amongst her people, not to mention a disgrace to her parents. More or less by choice she has preferred to roam the woods rather than taking part in the community. And she has never taken note of the elders telling her to stay away from the ruins of old. Consequently she had collected a respectable amount of finds and riches even before she heard about the Ambrians and their hunger for Davokarâ€™s treasures.
As Thistle Hold opened its gates, Elda was one of the first to buy a small house inside the palisade. She leads a simple life, develops her network of explorers and fortune-hunters, and keeps her stall at the Antique Plaza relatively well-stocked with interesting items. The commissions she collects to hand out certificates of authenticity and to peddle the merchandise are lower than that of most competitors, which may be a reason for newly hatched fortune-hunters to stay on her good side. Additionally, she keeps full track of all rumors of interesting hunting grounds and may very well give adventurers a nudge in the right direction, in exchange for the right of first refusal on any noteworthy finds.
