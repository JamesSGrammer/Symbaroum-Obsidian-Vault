The characterâ€™s life is short, even under favorable living conditions. All members of its race tend to reach adulthood in a handful of years, after which they start to lose their youthful vigor so that only a few ever live to see the age of forty. On the other hand, they are quick to learn and adapt to new surroundings, and they are often ready to face the world at the age of five. Short-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.
