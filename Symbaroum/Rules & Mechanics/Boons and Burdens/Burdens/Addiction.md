The character has developed an addiction and must have a dose of his or her drug each day, or suffer from withdrawal symptoms. The drug (wine, dream snuff, daft root or similar) costs one shilling per dose. An alchemist can create the drug for himself or a friend for half that price. Withdrawal symptoms give a –1 modification to all tests and grow worse day-by-day, up to –5. Each day without the drug, the character must also pass a [Resolute –the abstinence modification] test. If it fails, he or she will abandon all other projects and start hunting for the daily dose.
