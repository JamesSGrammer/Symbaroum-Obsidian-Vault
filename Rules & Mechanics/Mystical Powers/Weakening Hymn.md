**Tradition**: Troll Singing 
**Material**: None, but the mystic must sing out loud
Throughout history, many taunting songs have been written about the faint of heart and in these tunes there are debilitating harmonies to be exploited by mystics who know how. The mystic repeatedly sings this infectious theme while fighting, thereby spreading cowardliness and weakness amongst his or her enemies.
The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost by taking damage [Resolute –Damage].

- Novice **Free**. With a passed [Persuasive←Resolute] test, the mystic can give each wounded enemy a second chance to fail all success tests while the singing continues; one test is made for each wounded enemy.
- Adept **Free**. With a passed [Persuasive←Resolute] test, the mystic can give each enemy (wounded or not) a second chance to fail all success tests while the singing continues.
- Master **Free**. With a passed [Persuasive←Resolute] test, the mystic can give each enemy (wounded or not) a second chance to fail all success tests. Furthermore, all enemies that fail a success test because of the Weakening Hymn suffer 1D4 damage, ignoring armor – caused by them being physically affected by harrowing lyrics that conjure past failures.
