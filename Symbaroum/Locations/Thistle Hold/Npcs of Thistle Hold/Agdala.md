The witch Agdala is not the most amenable person in town. She appears to loathe Thistle Hold and if one was to judge from how it occasionally sounds in her presence she hates her son Alomar even more – for being good for nothing, for forcing her to live among the Ambrians, for not having given her any grandchildren. The one thing that seems to put her in a good mood is when she has the opportunity to gossip about the members and doings of other clans – which she claims to know everything about. And, if in good spirits, she can be helpful in other ways too. First of all, she is still a powerful witch and can be persuaded to help as long as she perceives the end as justified and good – rumor has it that she, given appropriate payment, has spoken to the dead and delivered predictions with great precision. Adding to that, there is probably no one in the Hold who is so versed in barbarian legends as Agdala, both when it comes to telling them and interpreting their true meanings. People who have sought out the old witch tend to describe the meeting with a trembling voice and eyes flickering from anxiety. Apparently, she prefers favors to thaler as payment, and she threatens everyone that curses will plague he who passes on the information she has provided. With that in mind, it is not so strange that the people of Thistle Hold would rather frighten their children with the hag Agdala than with the Huldra of Karvosti.
