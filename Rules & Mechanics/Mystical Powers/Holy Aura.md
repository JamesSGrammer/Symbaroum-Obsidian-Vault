**Tradition**: Theurgy
**Material**: Holy symbol. 
The mystic can send out a holy and life-affirming aura that harms abominations and the undead. At higher levels, this aura can also provide healing powers for living creatures.

---
- Novice **Active**. With a successful Resolute test the mystic envelops itself in an aura of holy energies that is harmful to abominations and undead. The target suffers 1D6 points of damage, ignoring Armor. This power affects all abominations and undead within sight of the mystic and is ongoing until the mystic fails a Resolute test or breaks con centration. The mystic can exclude allied abominations or undead from the effect of the Holy Aura.
- Adept **Active**. The aura now deals 1D8 damage to abominations and undead, while living creatures heal 1D4 points of Toughness each turn.
- Master **Active**. Same effect as at adept level, but the effect against abominations and undead is increased to 1D10. Living allies now heal 1D6 points of Toughness each turn.
