Among Ambria’s knights and their squires, the efficiency of jointed chain-weapons has long been known. New ways of using jointed weapons have emerged on the battlefield, and these techniques have been passed on to other warriors. The character has studied the secrets of the jointed weapons and learned to make full use of their potential.

---
- Novice **Passive**. In the character’s hands, a jointed weapon gains the quality Ensnaring, and may therefore be used to ensnare an enemy, instead of for making a normal attack.
- Adept **Passive**. The character can put great force into the secondary damage of jointed weapons; such hits now deal 1D8 damage, instead of 1D6.
- Master **Active**. The master flailer can use a jointed weapon to continue to strike even after having hit a target. The character may perform attacks against all enemies within range of melee; each attack is rolled separately.
