| **Blight-stricken** | Total Corruption 1+                                   | The corruption can be detected with the Witchsight ability and rituals like Holy Smoke. Temporary Corruption fades away at the end of a scene.                                                                                                    |
| **Blight-marked**   | Corruption Threshold (Resolute/2 rounded up) reached. | The player character develops a physical Stigma as a sign of its corruption. A Stigma triggered by temporary Corruption will heal and vanish after a day, while a permanent Stigma remains until permanent Corruption is reduced through rituals. |
| **Abomination**     | Resolute reached.                                     | The creature is thoroughly corrupt. The player character turns into an abomination and becomes a non-player character. No known ritual can save the character.                                                                                    |
