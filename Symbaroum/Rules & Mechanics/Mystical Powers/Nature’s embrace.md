**Tradition**: Witchcraft
**Material**: A fistful of soil.
The deep soil of the world is a safe place for the mystic, just as the mountain rock may become a shelter. The mystic can sink into the earth and thereby avoid attacks from its enemies.

---
- Novice **Active**. The mystic is able to sink into the earth if a successful Resolute test is made. There, the mystic is invulnerable but also unable to take any Actions. The mystic must succeed with another Resolute test each turn to remain in the safe bosom of the earth. If the mystic fails the test, then he or she is returned to the surface.
- Adept **Active**. The mystic can use mystical powers on itself while in the earth and does not have to test Resolute in order to remain there.
- Master **Active**. The mystic can move by using its Movement Action to appear in a different spot than where it first sank into the ground. The mystic can also use powers on its allies while in the earth, as well as see the allies through the protective layers of soil.
