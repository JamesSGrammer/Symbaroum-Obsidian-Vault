The group has to decide whether it is allowed to use [Persuasive←Resolute] against other player characters. Some will think that social pressure is a fact within a small group, and therefore keep that option; other groups might think that this ruins the game, since it takes away some of the charm of roleplaying games: to be able to act freely in a fantasy world. Both sides are right. The standing recommendation is to let it vary, and only allow the use of Persuasive against other player characters in dramatically crucial situations. “Do not kill her” is dramatically interesting while “Give me your share of the treasure” is not. To have some guidelines for when it is appropriate and to have the right to veto from the player whose character is exposed to the attempt, is probably a feasible way to go.
