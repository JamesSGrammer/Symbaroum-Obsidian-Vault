The creature has a long tongue which can be used to attack and grapple targets which are within two movement actions away. The attack counts and deals damage as a bite, and if the target has at least one level lower than the creature in the trait Robust, the creature may try to pull the target into melee range. The target rolls a [Strong←Strong] test; if it fails, the target is pulled towards the creature which then can combine Grappling Tongue with other traits, such as Devour and Crushing Embrace.
