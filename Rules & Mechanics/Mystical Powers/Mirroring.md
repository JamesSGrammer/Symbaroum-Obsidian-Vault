**Tradition**: Only available to Illusionist 
**Material**: A couple of small figurines
Reality’s layers of misconceptions and lies may be used to project a series of conceivable phenomena, only one of which corresponds to the reality of the world. The multiple false images created this way serve to protect the mystic from hostile attacks – in most cases; there is always the risk that the enemy targets the mystic instead of an illusion. Every attack against the mystic has a chance of hitting one of the projections or the mystic: if three illusions are made, the chance of the mystic being targeted is 1 out of 4. As the illusions are destroyed, the mystic’s risk of being hit increases.
