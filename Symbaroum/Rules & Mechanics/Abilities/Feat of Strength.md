- Novice **Passive**. The character can handle taking a beating and counts Toughness as [Strong +5]. This does not affect the Pain Threshold, which is based on Strong/2 as usual.
- Adept **Reaction**. The character grows stronger by suffering damage. When the character’s Toughness is halved, he has a second chance to pass all tests against Strong, including attacks if rolled against Strong.
- Master **Reaction**. The character grows even stronger when severely damaged. When the character’s Toughness is halved, he or she deals +1D4 melee damage, in addition to the effect mentioned at the adept level.
