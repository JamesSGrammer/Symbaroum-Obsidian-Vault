**Tradition**: Symbolism 
**Material**: A prepared symbol 
Intricate runes emit energies that can temporarily blind those who are bedazzled by the light. The effect of a Blinding Symbol is immediately suspended if the victim uses a dose of Eye Drops.

---
- Novice **Active**. The runes trigger a chain of blinding energies. The target closest to the symbol is blinded if the mystic passes a [Resolute←Resolute] test; if this succeeds, an attempt is made to blind the next enemy and so on, until a test fails. The victims are only blinded for one turn before automatically regaining their sight.
- Adept **Active**. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test or loses concentration [Resolute –Damage].
- Master **Active**. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the afflicted regains Toughness from healing powers or elixirs.
