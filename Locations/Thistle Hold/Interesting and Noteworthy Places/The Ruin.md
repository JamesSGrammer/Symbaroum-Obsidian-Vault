In Thistle Hold there are many guest houses and inns of varying quality. The representatives of the Queen and the noble houses gladly visit the Court and Harp at the Antique Plaza or the Winged Ladle near the eastern gate; explorers often stay at the Seamstress’ Rest close to the tower of Ordo Magica, while less wealthy visitors tend to be drawn to the establishments in the vicinity of the western gate –The Witch and Familiar, Arkerio’s Guest House or the cheap but flea-infested Rose Garden. But for treasure-hunters, there is no place like the Ruin. The guest house is as old as the town itself and has had many distinguished patrons. For example, it is said that Iasogoi Brigo stayed at the Ruin before going on the expedition that raised him to the skies, and the same has been said about Lysindra Goldengrasp. Should one put faith in the claims made by the owner, Master Pergalo, those two names are but the start of a long list of successful fortune-hunters who have blessed their expeditions by spending a night under his roof. In addition, many are tempted by the inn’s afternoon soup, cooked over an open fire in a giant cauldron recovered close to where the Toad’s Square’s skeleton was unearthed. No one has been able to decipher the archaic inscription covering it, but whatever they may say there is no doubt that the cauldron is perfect for cooking soup.
