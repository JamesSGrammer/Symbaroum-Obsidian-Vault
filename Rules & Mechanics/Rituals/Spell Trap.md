**Tradition**: Symbolism
The mystic binds a power to a certain location or to an object. Note that the powers of Symbolism do not have to be bound this way; this is covered by the Adept level of Symbolism. Spell Trap is instead used for powers not included in that tradition.
All Spell Traps need to be given a trigger criterion when created. Such a criterion can, for instance, be that a living creature enters the room, that someone steps on the Spell Trap or that a weapon is drawn in the vicinity. The mystic can exclude him- or herself from being able to trigger the trap, but the allies of the mystic are not excluded – if they meet the criterion, the power is activated.
The mystic who makes the Spell Trap does not have to know the power which is to be trapped, but in that case he or she needs the assistance of a mystic who does or a scroll that describes the power. The Spell Trap can be dispelled with [[Anathema]] or the ritual [[Break Link]]; if not, it remains dormant for years – decades, sometimes centuries – before its energies dissipate.
