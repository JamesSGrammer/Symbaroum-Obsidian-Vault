The character is trained to open locks, latches and bolts, and gets a +1 bonus on all tests to pick locks â€“ the test is made against Quick if the burglar is in a hurry or against Discreet when the challenge is to not alert anyone on the other side of the door. A Discreet test is also rolled to conceal that the lock has been picked, should someone investigate later on. Cat Burglar can be acquired multiple times, up to a maximum bonus of +3 on relevant tests.
