**Tradition**: Blessing
Stone, soil, plants and ore can bind those who threaten a servant of the gods. The mystic can let the unrighteous sink into the ground, deep enough to prevent all movement, possibly in such a tight grip that it harms the target.

---
- Novice Free. Once per turn, with a successful Resolute test, the mystic can let a target sink into, and get stuck in, the ground. The bound creature is unable to move, but may use ranged weapons and mystical powers. The creature remains bound until the mystic loses concentration or fails a [Resolute←Strong] test.
- Adept Free. Once per turn the mystic can establish a chain of earthbinds. If the mystic manages to bind a target with a Resolute test, he or she may attempt to bind another one, and so on until an attempt fails. Affected targets remain bound until the mystic loses concentration or fails a [Resolute←Strong] test.
- Master Free. Like Adept, but the ground is clamped so tightly around the victim's legs that he or she also takes 1D6 damage per turn (ignoring Armor).
