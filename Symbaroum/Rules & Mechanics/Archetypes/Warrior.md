Anyone can Take up arms against the authorities, those who are better off or to loyally protect their lord. Constant war and conflicts have led to the emergence of military orders and groups characterized by combat skills and lifestyles that mirror their worldviews. The Advanced Player’s Guide introduces a number of new warrior occupations; they are all unique examples of how the constant of war has fostered the development of skills, community and institutions in both Ambria and Davokar.
The templar knights may be seen as the ultimate expression of how submission can lead to extraordinary power. Karvosti’s Wrath Guards serve their High Chieftain, but some say they really fight and die for each other, for their brothers and sisters in blood, rather than for some higher purpose. Eastern Davokar is home to rune covered warriors, their flesh a tapestry of carved tattoos that summarizes the Symbolists’ knowledge of war. There are also strong warrior traditions among trolls and elves – the rune smiths of the trolls wield their hammers as effectively on the battlefield as in the smithy, while abducted humans often utilize a spear dance as deadly as it is old.
The most pronounced characteristic of these warriors is something they all have in common: they must rise to the challenge, or fall. This quality is captured by the archetypical ability [[Feat of Strength]].

### Warriors and The Races
Of the races presented in the Advanced Player’s Guide, primarily abducted humans and trolls are regarded as great warriors. The trolls, with a culture based on physical challenges, are known to have bred many warriors. The aggressive, hot-headed abductees often serve the same purpose among their new families in the woods. Also, the undead may very well have a history full of violence – a possible explanation for their state of undeath.
