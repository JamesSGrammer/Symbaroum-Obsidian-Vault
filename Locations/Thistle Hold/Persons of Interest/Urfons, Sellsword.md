Two years ago, while searching for berries in the outskirts of Davokar, the goblin Urfons happened upon a hunter who had been torn asunder by a forest beast. By the cadaver remained the hunter’s sword. Urfons hid his find under the moss and returned to it day after day to admire and polish the shiny, sharp-edged weapon.
As he grew strong enough to wield it he spent several hours each day fighting against imaginary enemies, stones and bushes. And even though he never learned any special technique, he became more and more skilled at trailing and utilizing the weight of the weapon in a kind of raging, twirling sword-dance.
Urfons is big and strong for a goblin, and has matured into one of Mother Mehira’s most experienced sellswords. He may not be as skilled as the legendary war veteran Serex Attio or the axe-wielding warmaiden Vanoya Skullsplitter, but on the other hand he is neither an alcoholic nor especially touchy. What more is, Urfons has actu ally survived a handful of expeditions to mythic locations far past the brighter parts of Davokar. He can easily find his way back if someone would pay him for guidance to the Columns of Haganor or the Cave Town of Keruan.
