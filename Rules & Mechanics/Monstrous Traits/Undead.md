- **I Passive**. The undead creature is not affected by poison or diseases, but takes the usual damage from physical effects except that the Pain Thresh old is not used (pain and shock do not affect the walking corpse). The walking corpse does not heal naturally and is not affected by alchemical healing elixirs, but must instead eat raw meat (living or recently killed) or drink blood to heal, each point of Toughness that the creature consumes heals it by 2 points of Toughness.
- **II Passive.** The walking corpse suffers only half damage from ordinary physical effects, such as weapons or elemental damage. Mystical powers that ignore Armor deal full damage as usual. 
- **III Passive.** The walking corpse suffers only half damage from alchemical and mystical effects as well, but takes full damage from magical weapons and holy effects.
