**Tradition**: Sorcery

The mystic may summon heavy rhythms that seduce people present in the area; the music is heard far and wide, but only those within a hundred meters are actually affected. Every person neutral to the mystic must pass a test against Resolute or be drawn into the dance. The mystic is immune, but his or her allies are not. The allies, as well as direct enemies, get a second chance to pass the test against Resolute (roll twice, use the best outcome). Death-dancers are not controlled per se, but highly inclined to obey the mystic's commands; as long as they involve violence against someone not considered a friend, they will attack. Death dancers may roll against Resolute every time they kill another creature, and also every time they suffer damage. The Dance of Death is bound to the mystic, and follows wherever he or she goes. The dance lasts as long as the mystic wishes, but dancers lose 1d4 Toughness with every hour. The ritual can be stopped entirely with [[Break Link]]. Individual death dancers can be freed with the ritual [[Exorcism]], but the mystical power [[Anathema]] would be more effective.
