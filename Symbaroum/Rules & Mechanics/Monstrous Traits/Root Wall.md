The creature can extend its root system and have it shoot up from the ground to hinder enemy movement. At higher levels, the wall can also deal damage to those trying to pass it, or even grip and hold them.

- I **Action**: *Active*. The creature raises its roots like a wall from the ground, wide enough for it to take two movement actions to get around it. The wall could also be used to block a cave or similar opening. The wall can be destroyed, according to the rules on Damage on Buildings in the Advanced Player’s Guide (page 106). The root wall has Toughness 10, Breakpoint 5 and Fortification value 5. The root wall remains for an entire scene, unless it is destroyed or the creature opts to spend a new active action to move it. If destroyed, a new root wall cannot be raised until the next day. 
- II **Action**: *Active*. As I, but enemies that come close to the wall must pass a [Quick←Accurate] test or be hit by flaying branches, dealing 3 damage (ignoring Armor). The only way to avoid this is to spend another movement action when rounding the wall, a total of three, and hence bypass the wall at a safe distance. 
- III **Action**: *Free*. As II, but the flaying branches deal 5 damage. If they hit and if the target fails a [Strong←Strong] test, the target is also gripped until it passes a [Strong←Strong] test, or the wall is destroyed or moved. A gripped target is not attacked by flaying branches again until the moment when it succeeds in getting free.
