Anyone can defend themselves with a shield, providing +1 to Defense. The use of a shield makes it impossible to use ranged and *Heavy* weapons and neutralizes the reach advantage gained from a *[[Long]]* weapon, since the wielder must use it in one hand. The buckler is an exception to this, allowing the use of both hands, as well as giving the user +1 to Defense.
