**Price**: 50 [[Thaler]]
**Damage**: 1D12
**Quality**: Ballista
Essentially, the ballista is a massive, stationary crossbow, intended to fire at fixed targets, troop formations on the field and monsters of the most robust sort. In The Great War, the ballista was used against the undead draft beasts of the Dark Lords, with the intent of stopping their siege towers from reaching the ramparts. This continued during the colonization of Ambria, with the tame beasts of the barbarian warlords as the primary targets. Even today, ballistae are aimed towards Davokar from atop outposts and wall-towers
