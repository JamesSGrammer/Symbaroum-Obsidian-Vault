The weapon is forged in hate and hardened with vengeance, aimed at a specific group of creatures: Elves, Winged Creatures, Undead, Humans, Reptiles, Spiders, Abominations, Trolls or Predators (see page 209 in the Core Rulebook). In this respect, Changelings count as Elves while ogres and goblins count as Trolls. Dwarves are a group in their own right. The Bane Weapon deals +1d4 damage against members of the selected group and also glows softly in their presence, giving a +1 bonus to *Vigilant* when testing to discover that such a creature is in the vicinity.
