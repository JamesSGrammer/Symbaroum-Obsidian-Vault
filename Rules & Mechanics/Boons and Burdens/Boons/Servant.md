The character has a personal servant. It may be an employed attendant, a serf chamber boy or some thing like that. The servant is loyal to the player character, but is otherwise useless in terms of skills (weak resistance). It can perform simple chores, stand guard at night or convey messages to others, but it will not contribute in dangerous situations. The servant is played by the Game Master and should be provided a suitable personality.
