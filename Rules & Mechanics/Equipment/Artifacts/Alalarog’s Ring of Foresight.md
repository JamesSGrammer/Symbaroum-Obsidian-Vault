Many old barbarian legends, including a popular verse supposedly written by Aroaleta, tell of the warrior Alalarog’s unfailing ability to foresee the movements of beasts and human opponents. Some say he was chosen by the gods, sent to protect his people from the predatory forces of the forest; others that his ability was the result of mystical powers cast at the time of his birth. But the truth is written on the simple ring of gold which he wore in his right ear lobe. He and his friends stole the earring from a group of grave robbers whom they attacked on their way home from a Symbarian crypt. There was a bloody fight over the valuable object, and soon Alalarog was the only one alive, tormented by anguish after having killed his friends, and determined to atone for his crimes through good deeds..
