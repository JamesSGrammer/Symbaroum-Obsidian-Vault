**Tradition**: Blessing
With wild gestures and chanting song, the mystic can make the earth itself attack those who threaten a servant of the gods – rocks are pulled from underneath soil and grass, and hurled forcefully at the unrighteous target.

---
- Novice **Active**. The mystic pulls a sharp-edged boulder from the earth and hurls it at a target. With a successful [Resolute←Quick] test the attack hits, dealing 1D8 damage.
- Adept **Active**. Like Novice, but the mystic pulls 1D4 boulders from the ground, which may be hurled at either one or multiple targets. Each rock counts as a separate attack.
- Master **Active**. Like Adept, but instead of boulders, swarms of smaller rocks are hurled forcefully at the victim/victims. The projectiles are small and sharp enough to hit their target through tiny gaps, creases, and cracks, thereby ignoring Armor.
