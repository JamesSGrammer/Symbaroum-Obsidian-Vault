The Andriks first appeared in Freetown, west of Alberetor. Whether they arrived by boat or were in fact created in the practically lawless city remains unclear. What is evident, however, is that they soon blended with the city’s underclass and that they came to stay. From Freetown, the Andriks spread along the coast, to the east as well as the west, in search of a more dignified life. And when Alberetor was evacuated, the Andriks followed the humans to Ambria.
Most of Ambria’s andriks spend their entire lives on the move, as solitary peddler families or several families working together as river merchants. The most famous are the Andrik Buccaneers who plague the waters of Ambria with their fast vessels. These web-footed raiders harbor ideas of andrik superiority, as they are the most recently evolved of all cultural beings and therefore – according to their pirate logic – the greatest. They have even assumed a new name for their kind: andrake. The andrake pirates are few, but extremely active, and feathered corsairs are priority targets for the Ambrian galleys hunting pirates on the kingdom’s rivers. This has driven the andrakes to the outskirts of the realm. They have often sought refuge in remote harbors in the no-man’s-land of southern Davokar, where dense vegetation and numerous tributaries provide excellent conditions for piracy.

### Andrik Traits
Andriks have the Diminutive, Pariah and Paws traits. Many also have the Provocative trait, which is acquired like other abilities.

### Andrik Names
Andriks have a lax attitude toward personal names, and usually give each other nicknames based on appearance, such as Big-mitts, One-eye, Grayfeather, Bareback, Shaggy, Shade, and Highplume. At least a few larger andrik families have completely abandoned the use of names in favor of a simpler numeral system, where numbers indicate the order of birth.

### Andriks as Adventurers
An andrik who leaves its family usually has compelling reasons for doing so. In many cases, the family is dead or the andrik was banished from the community for having committed some serious offense.
Andriks with a background in trade are often thieves, while those who grew up with pirates are usually warriors. There are no known examples of andrik mystics, nor any indications that they can learn to perform rituals. However, rumors speak of an andrik oracle in Freetown – a tale which has given its name to an inn in the town of Kastor: The Duck and Crystal.

## Andrik Traits
**Paws, Trait/Burden**: The creature has poorly developed hands, making it difficult to perform fine motor tasks such as lockpicking. Whenever a challenge requires hand dexterity, the creature has a second chance to fail.

**Provocative, Trait**: The creature has a knack for provoking everyone it meets to such an extent that it can become useful as a distraction during combat. The trait requires no success test if the enemy is already consumed with rage (the Berserker ability); then it succeeds automatically. However, enemies with the Steadfast ability are allowed two attempts to regain their composure every turn.

---
- **Novice Free**. With a successful [Resolute←Cunning] test the creature can provoke an enemy beyond all reason. If successful, the creature has a second chance to pass all tests to avoid being affected by the enemy’s actions (such as Defense). Only one enemy at a time can be fazed this way. The effect lasts for the rest of the scene without further tests, but if the creature wishes to provoke another enemy a new [Resolute←Cunning] test is required. 
- **Adept Free**. Like I, but the enemy also becomes careless in its defense. If the [Resolute←Cunning] test succeeds, the creature has a second chance to pass all success tests against the enemy. 
- **Master Active**. The creature is a master teaser, and can pass a Cunning test to throw an entire group of enemies off balance. If successful, all enemies start to seethe with reckless rage and the creature has two chances to succeed with defense, resisting influence, and attacks against all enemies for the duration of the scene.
