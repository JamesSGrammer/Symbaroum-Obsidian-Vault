To some players, it might seem appropriate for severe wounds to affect the chance of succeeding with future success tests. For these groups, we recommend the following rule: Whenever a creature suffers damage that surpasses its Pain Threshold, it is given a second chance to fail all success tests till the end of the scene. A player character that is critically damaged rolls twice whenever it makes a test and picks the worst result (the higher number). If it is the enemy who is critically wounded, the player rolls twice and picks the better result (the lower number). The effect of the critical damage lasts until the creature recovers or is healed at least one (1) point of Toughness. Note that this rule does not affect undead, since they have no Pain Threshold â€“ technically, they become more powerful if this optional rule is used, since everybody else become more vulnerable.
