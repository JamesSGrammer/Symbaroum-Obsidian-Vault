**Tradition**: Symbolism
Anyone who sees the rousing motif of the symbol feels a burning urge to fight which, unless they can resist the effect, drives them into a ruthless and possibly even suicidal berserker rage.

---

- Novice ***Active***. The symbol fills a chain of creatures with an uncontrollable urge to fight; the victim closest to the symbol is affected first [Resolute←Resolute]; if the victim is affected, a new test is made for the next enemy, and so on until someone can resist the energies. The effect lasts one turn and causes the victim to immediately attack the nearest individual, friend or foe.
- Adept ***Active***. Like Novice, but the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test or loses concentration [Resolute –Damage].
- Master ***Active***. Like Adept, but the affected are so consumed with bloodlust that they fail to defend themselves against incoming attacks; all attacks against the affected hit automatically.
