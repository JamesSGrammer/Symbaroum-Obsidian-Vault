**Tradition**: Witchcraft
With a passed Resolute test, the mystic binds a creature to a mission. The ritual requires a mystical link to the target â€“ some hair strands, a puddle of blood or an item that the target holds dear. If successful, the target immediately knows what it must do but not who has actually bound him or her to the mission or task. The effect of the ritual is that the creature has a second chance to pass one test per scene while trying to complete the mission. On the other hand, he or she has a second chance to fail all tests during scenes which are not directly related to the mission. 
Burdened by Fate can be dispelled by the ritual Break Link.
