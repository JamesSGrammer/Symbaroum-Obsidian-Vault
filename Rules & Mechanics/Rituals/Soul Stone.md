Tradition: Wizardry
Corruption was never a problem to wizards before The Great War, since their meticulous practices protected them from blackening their souls. During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone.
The ritual binds the mystic to the crystal, which then works as an extension of the wizard’s soul. The ritual allows the mystic to move 1D4 points of permanent Corruption to the soul stone with a successful Resolute test. The stone can hold up to half of the mystic’s Resolute in Corruption; it darkens as it fills up and detonates if said limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result. In the unlikely case that he or she survives that wave of Corruption, it is possible for the mystic to bind itself to a new soul stone and start over.
The ritual costs one (1) point of Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. A wizard that manages to learn the ritual receives a soul stone from its order chapter; other mystics must pay their own way. To buy a soul stone costs 100 thaler.
