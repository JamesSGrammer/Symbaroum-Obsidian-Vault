**Price**: 12 [[Thaler]]
The miraculous drug called Spirit Friend is cooked in a cauldron, but it is not the liquid that is bottled, but the vapors. The gray-white smoke is captured in small ceramic jars and inhaled when needed. Spirit Friend gives the user level I in the trait [[Spirit Form]]. The effect lasts for 1d4 turns, to the price of as many points in temporary corruption.
