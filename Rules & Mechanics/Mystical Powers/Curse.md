**Tradition**: Witchcraft, Sorcery
**Material**: None, a dark glare is enough. 
The mystic masters the stare of the Evil Eye and can curse enemies on the battlefield; a power often used by the disciples of the Dark Lords during The Great War

---
- Novice **Free**. Once per turn, the mysticâ€™s dark glare automatically gives an enemy a second chance to fail all success tests meant to affect the mystic (roll twice, the action fails if one of the tests is a failure). This effect is ongoing until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
- Adept **Free**. Like novice, but the enemy has a second chance to fail all its success tests regardless of target. The effect is ongoing until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
- Master **Active**. The mystic puts a curse of death upon an enemy. The enemy suffers 1D6 dam age, ignoring Armor, for all actions it tries to perform. The target suffers no damage if it remains still and passive. This effect is active until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
