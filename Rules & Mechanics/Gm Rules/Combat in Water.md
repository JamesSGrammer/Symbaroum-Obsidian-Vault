Fighting while wading, with arms and head above water, gives a second chance to fail all success tests. Fighting while swimming, submerged and with no contact with the se abed, gives a second chance to fail all success tests and halves the damage dealt with all physical attacks, including fire based mystical powers.
Also, a creature fighting while submerged in water must roll a test against Strong each turn; a failure gives one point in Toughness damage because of the straining effort and oxygen deficiency. 
Creatures with the trait Amphibian suffer no negative effects from figh ting in water. Undead beings have a second chance to fail all success tests, but do not suffer any damage from being submerged.
