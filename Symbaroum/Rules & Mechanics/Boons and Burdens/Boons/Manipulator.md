The character knows how to manipulate others, using flattery, threats, or a combination thereof. He or she gets a +1 bonus to Persuasive versus a specific person during the scene. It takes time to influence someone; it requires a scene of emotional manipu lations to achieve the intended effect. On the other hand, the influence lasts longer than when simply lying â€“ the victim accepts the sentiments as its own and will defend them long after the manipulator has left the place. Manipulator can be acquired multiple times, up to a maximum bonus of +3 on relevant tests.
