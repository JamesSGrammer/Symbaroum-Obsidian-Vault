The slender grip and the thin feather steel of the blade makes the Assassinâ€™s Blade easy to conceal without sacrificing its bite. It is easily strapped to the wrist or ankle, or even attached behind the neck with a lump of resin. Special girdles or hidden pockets in clothes work just as well. The weapon can be smuggled past guards, to be used on secret missions or to be handed over to a prisoner.
