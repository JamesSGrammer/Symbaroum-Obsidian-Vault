Laminated armor is an older armor-type, nowadays often replaced by the cheaper scale mail or the flexible chain mail. However, some old laminated sets of armor are still around and there are blacksmiths who actually prefer them because of their greater protective capability. Some of Ambria’s noble houses still dress in this type of armor, for sentimental… or, as they claim, *”traditional”* reasons.
Laminated armor can only protect the torso, shoulders and hips – arms and legs are usually dressed in studded leather to maintain mobility.
