All player characters can search for information in archives and libraries, but to find anything at all they obviously need to search in a place where the desired information can actually be found (in other words, searching for directions to Symbar at the town archives of Thistle Hold is hopeless). The Game Master must decide what is possible to find, and also how detailed the information is.
In practice, the search is based on the player characters directing a question to the collection of documents. If the Game Master deems that the documents may contain some relevant information, a character with the ability *[[Loremaster]]* rolls against *[[Cunning]]* while the others roll a test against [Cunning â€“5]. If everyone fails the test, they find nothing and have to move on to somewhere else. But if some one passes the test, the Game Master delivers a response to the question and the characters may continue searching the archive for answers to any supplementary questions. This goes on until all characters fail or the Game Master decided that no additional information can be found.
