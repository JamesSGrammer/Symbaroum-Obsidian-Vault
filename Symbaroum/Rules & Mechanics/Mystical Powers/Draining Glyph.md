**Tradition**: Symbolism 
**Material**: A carefully crafted glyph 
The mystic creates a glyph that upon activation becomes a whirling vortex, sucking the life-force from the enemy. The glyph affects all enemies who can see the symbol and are in front of it.

---
- Novice **Active**. With a [Resolute←Strong] test the mystic can damage every enemy in the vicinity (one test per target). The damage is 1D4, ignoring Armor. The effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test or loses concentration [Resolute –Damage].
- Adept **Active**. Same as the novice level, but the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
- Master **Active**. The master can direct part of the drained energy into himself or his allies; the stolen life-force heals the mystic or one of its allies, returning 1D4 points of Toughness per turn for as long as effect is active.
