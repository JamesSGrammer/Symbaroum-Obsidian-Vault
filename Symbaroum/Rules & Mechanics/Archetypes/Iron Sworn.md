The work of the Iron Pact is never done, which places great demands on its agents, the Iron Sworn. The pact was created by elves at the time of Symbaroum’s downfall, and after a long time in the shadows its members are on the move again, trying to stop the spreading darkness. Davokar must never awaken, not if the Iron Sworn can help it.
Nowadays, the Iron Pact recruits new agents from all races and cultures; anyone sympathetic to the struggle is tested in a series of both physical and moral challenges. Those who make it with both life and loyalty intact are invited to swear the Iron Oath. After that follows a time of training and further testing before initiates become true members of the Pact – agents devoted to the fight against corruption.
