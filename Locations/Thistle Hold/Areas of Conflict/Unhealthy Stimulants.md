The vegetation of Davokar can have the most aston ishing properties and to consume even the smallest seed can have devastating effects – just ask the explorer Lupina who literally was torn apart from inside by a Bellycreeper that had rooted itself in her throat. Some herbs have both positive and negative effects and there will always be gamblers willing to pay a high price for accelerated muscle growth, enhanced night vision, a rosy complexion or sensations of ecstasy – even if the cost is murderous rage, blood thirst or lifelong addiction.
There are of course also people exploiting the situation to make money. In most cases not even the venders know exactly what long-term effects are incurred from consuming their “medicaments”; sometimes they just ignore any side-effects and keep their trade to the shadows – as for instance the masked “Miracle Master” who periodically is seen in both Yndaros and the Hold, marketing his joy-inducing medicures.
