You have dedicated your life to fighting blight beasts, maybe as a consequence of having your own life torn apart by the growing and infectious darkness: a farm burned to the ground, the grave of your family, a friend’s horrendous transformation – something that reminds you of what will happen if the power of the blighted ones is not broken in time. You will stop at nothing in your fight against evil: you wield steel, fire and maybe even rituals learned from defeated sorcerers. You realize that the use of mystical powers may ultimately corrupt you too, but you turn a blind eye to that and instead fight on with the fervor of the fanatic.
