The creature is so small, slender and pitiful that it arouses sympathy even in enemies. In short, it is difficult to see it as a credible threat, even when it is armed. The effect of this is that enemies tend to choose other targets first; they must pass a [Resolute←Discreet] test to bring themselves to attack. The only exceptions are if the diminutive creature is the only possible target or if it shows that it actually can fight (that is, if it manages to deal damage to an enemy). Diminutive is immediately thwarted if the creature makes use of any Ability or Power, or of some other trait.
