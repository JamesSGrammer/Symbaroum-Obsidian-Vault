**Tradition**: Troll Singing 
The mystic can sing power words over a door, a lock or a gate to either seal it with mystical energies or open it, whether it is locked by a conventional lock or by mystical energies. Sealing a door requires no test, but to open it the mystic must pass a test against [Resolute←Difficulty], where the difficulty is decided by the difficulty of the lock mechanism or the Resolute of the mystic who sealed it. Locks that normally cannot be picked, which open to a password or similar, are counted as having Difficulty −8.
