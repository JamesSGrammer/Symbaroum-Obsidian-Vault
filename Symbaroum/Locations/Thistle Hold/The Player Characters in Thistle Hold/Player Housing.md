When you have made it through the gates you should not have a difficult time finding a place to spend the night. Ever since Blackmoor became a viable option for many treasure-hunters, there are often affordable rooms for hire at the Ruin, the Witch and Familiar and the Rose Garden. It is also both possible and cheap to rent a bed in some private households or in the barrack at the Garrison which is only used in times of trouble, when the town watch expands its numbers by hiring mercenaries.
Acquiring permanent lodging in Thistle Hold is a costly affair, but it is of course possible to buy houses as well as apartments, from private owners or from the Mayor. Concerning the latter, there is no room for any new buildings to be built, so the homes for sale are always ones which have been confiscated from some evicted or dead previous owner.
Another option is to lease a home from some landlord who has moved or is out traveling. But that often amounts to a higher cost than buying, since a fee for “permanent residency” is added, paid directly to the Mayor. However, lately many have chosen that alternative despite it being more expensive. The reason for this is the continuous growth of Blackmoor – the risk is that the prices of houses in the Hold will decline considerably if the tent camp is approved for permanent housing by the Queen.
