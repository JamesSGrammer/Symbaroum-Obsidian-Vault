The character has access to one or more mystical powers. 
These powers have either been obtained as a gift, a curse, through assiduous studies or as a consequence of a deep and dedicated faith. The character’s power may belong to a mystical tradition (Wizardry, Sorcery, Theurgy or Witchcraft), which all have their benefits and disadvantages. The character may also be a Mystic without a tradition, with a home brewed theory as to where these powers come from and what they are meant for. For more information see Chapter 18: Mystical Traditions (page 126). Each Mystical Power is its own ability and is purchased separately. For a more detailed description of the different mystical powers, see Chapter 19: Mystical Powers (page 130). **The character suffers one point (1) of permanent Corruption each time he or she learns a new mystical power. The Corruption can be reduced if the power is part of a mystical tradition that the character belongs to. The character also suffers 1d4 temporary Corruption each time this power is used. Again, the Corruption suffered can be reduced if the power is considered a part of a tradition that the character belongs to** (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174). 

- Novice **Special**. The character has mastered the power’s novice level. 
- Adept **Special**. The character has mastered the power’s adept level.
