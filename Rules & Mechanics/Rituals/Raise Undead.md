**Tradition**: Sorcery
The mystic has the ability to grant permanent (un)life to a newly dead creature that perished no more than seven days earlier. For the undead to fall under the mystic’s control after the ritual’s completion, the mystic must successfully roll a test against [Resolute←Resolute]. Should the test fail, the undead awakens with its own will intact and is then free to decide for itself whether or not to follow the mystic. If the test is successful, the creature must obey the mystic as if bound by a slave rune, and can only be freed by the death of its master.
The creature keeps all stats and abilities it had in life and is also gifted with the monstrous trait [[HomeBrew/Ruins of Symbaroum/Rules & Mechanics/Monstrous Traits/Undead|Undead]] at level I. It does not age but will not go on forever, since its body is in a constant state of slow decomposition. The creature must make a test against Strong each year – if the test fails the creature’s value in Strong is reduced by one point. When the Strong value reaches 0, the body finally falls apart and the creature meets its final death.
