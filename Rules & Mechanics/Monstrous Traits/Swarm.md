The creature is a collective, its mind spread among a swarm of bodies. The creature cannot be destroyed unless the entire swarm is obliterated.

---

- **I Special.** The swarm suffers half damage from all attacks. If the swarm is damaged, and is brought down to below half its Toughness, the survival instinct of the separate parts of the swarm takes over and its instincts cause the rest of the swarm to flee. A mental attack (where the swarm uses its Resolute to defend itself) affects the entire swarm.
- **II Special.** The swarm suffers half damage from all attacks. If the swarm suffers damage from a single attack that exceeds its Pain Threshold, the survival instinct of the separate parts of the swarm takes over and its instincts cause the rest of the swarm to flee. Also, the swarm may make two attempts to resist mental attacks (where the swarm uses its Resolute to defend itself).
- **III Special.** The collective mind of the swarm controls it, so that it only suffers a quarter of any damage taken from attacks. The swarmâ€™s cohesion is complete, and the swarm does not have to flee unless the overall intellect chooses to do so. The swarm may make two attempts to resist mental attacks (where the swarm uses its Resolute to defend itself)
