Among the wagon-riding Varaks and Saars who live on the plains west of Davokar, bow-making is a highly esteemed art form. The composite bow is made from layers of horn and sinews over a wooden core; it is shorter and not as precise as the longbow but more powerful. Its size makes it perfect for use while on horseback, the driverâ€™s seat or the narrow platform of a battle chariot.
