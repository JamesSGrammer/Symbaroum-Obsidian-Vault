**Tradition**: Sorcery
**Material**: The mysticâ€™s own permanent corruption. 
A mystic with permanent corruption can spew out its inner darkness and infect others with corruption, or heal already tainted creatures.

---
- Novice **Active**. One (1) creature is hit; roll 1D4 against its total corruption. If the roll is equal to or lower than the corruption value, the creature heals an amount equal to the outcome of the roll; if higher, the creature suffers the outcome in temporary corruption.
- Adept **Active**. Like Novice, but the roll is 1D6.
- Master **Active**. Same as Adept level, but the attack is made in a chain, where another target is hit if the previous one suffered corruption. As soon as someone is healed, the chain is broken.
