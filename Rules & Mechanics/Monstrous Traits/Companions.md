The creature is never alone, never encountered without its companions in tow. The trait does not decide who the companions are, only how many and how strong they are. The companions may be the creatureâ€™s offspring, loyal servants or whatever seems suitable. 
Note that a creature needs to be of at least Challenging resistance to be able to have the trait Companions.
