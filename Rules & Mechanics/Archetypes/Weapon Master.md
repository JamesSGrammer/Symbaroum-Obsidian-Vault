Among the warriors of Ambria and Davokar there are those who have committed themselves to becoming true masters of a specific weapon. Through persistent training, these weapon masters have become very skilled with their weapon of choice, and often adhere to a philosophy about the struggle between life and death.
They are known as Sword Saints in Ambria, devoted to perfecting their skill with the chosen weapon. Among barbarians there are the Axe Artists, often wielding one axe in each hand â€“ a tradition also adopted by some of the goblin tribes of Davokar. The Elven equivalent to a weapon master is called a Spear Dancer, an art form also practiced by abducted humans. Among trolls, chain weapons are considered extra noble, both very demanding and very effective in the right hands. Such Flailers, in the form of ogres, can often be found in the gladiatorial arenas of Ambria.
