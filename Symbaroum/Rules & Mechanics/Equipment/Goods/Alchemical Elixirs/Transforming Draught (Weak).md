This is a powerful mutagen which transforms the body of the user in a monstrous way. During a scene the user is twisted into a bestial half-creature and has a second chance to fail all *Persuasive* tests until the effect wears off. The draught gives the user a monstrous trait for the rest of the scene; the level of the trait is decided by the strength of the elixir. In addition, each dose consumed deals temporary corruption, also determined by the strength of the elixir. Of course, the physical transformation and the corrupting effect is reason enough for the elixir to be banned and only available on Ambriaâ€™s black market.
The following monstrous traits can be acquired, decided by the alchemist when brewing the elixir: [[Armored]], [[Natural Weapon]], [[HomeBrew/Ruins of Symbaroum/Rules & Mechanics/Monstrous Traits/Robust|Robust]] and [[Wings]].
**Weak**: The draught gives the selected trait at level I, to the cost of 1d4 temporary corruption. 
**Moderate**: The draught gives the selected trait at level II, to the cost of 1d6 temporary corruption. 
**Strong**: The draught gives the selected trait at level III, to the cost of 1d8 temporary corruption.
