Witches who are at one with the blood coursing through their veins sometimes choose the path of the Blood Wader. They wade where the blood runs thick and passionate and are often marked by their life choices; Blood Waders tend to be impetuous and driven by lust, and their physical transformations often include bestial features in the form of fangs, jakaar-eyes and fur-like hair-growth
