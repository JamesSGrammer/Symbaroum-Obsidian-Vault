**Tradition**: Witchcraft
The mystic can have a seed grow into a full sized plant by using this ritual. The form of the plant is partially under the control of the mystic, and a tree can become a bridge or smash a gate to splinters. However, the mystic has no control over the sea sons; the plant takes the form that it naturally has during the current season. The location where this seed is planted must meet the conditions required for the plant to grow to full size under natural circumstances. In other words, an oak cannot be planted in a dark cave without light and soil, but maybe vines can take root there and grow into lianas for people to climb. In a Witch Circle created by the same mystic, the ritual Quick Growth can be performed regardless of the season.
