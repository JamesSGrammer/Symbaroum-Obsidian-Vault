You are a knight who fights to break the enemy’s lines or to hold your own. Heavily armored on the outside and with a deep sense of duty on the inside, you fight for the favor of your lord, the lives of your allies or your own glory. Maybe you dream of one day becoming a member of the Queen’s royal guard or a Templar fighting in the name of Prios.
