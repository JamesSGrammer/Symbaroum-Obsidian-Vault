The character has a thirst for blood, easily awoken and hard to quench. The thirst appears if he or she takes damage and means that the character will not spare any enemies â€“ not even if they surrender. Trying to spare an enemy requires an almost over powering effort; it requires the character to sacrifice an Experience point and then pass a Vigilant test.
