Monsters and non-player characters die as soon as their *Toughness* reaches 0, unless the Game Master wants something else to happen. In any case, the rules for player characters are different.
When a character reaches 0 *Toughness* it collapses and is considered to be dying. At this point, it cannot help itself in any way. Each turn thereafter the player is forced to make a Death Test with 1D20 on the character’s Initiative. This test is repeated until someone else either stabilizes the dying character with an herbal cure, the *[[Medicus]]* ability or mystical healing – or until the player rolls a 1 and wakes up, or a 20 and dies.
