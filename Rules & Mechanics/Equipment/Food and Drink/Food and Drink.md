Bored nobles, homecoming treasure hunters and scrawny daythalers – they may appear to have nothing in common, but appearances are deceptive: they all know to appreciate a good meal! Then again, what they regard as a tasty meal, and what they are prepared to pay for it, differs very much between the representatives of these groups. Below is a list of food dishes, beverages and other types of stimulants. The listed dishes can be found on menus all over Ambria and some of them can also be offered in the settlements of the clans. But the prices listed must be seen as a guideline, since they can vary considerably – Afadir’s Triumph Tavern in Thistle Hold requests shining thalers of their customers, but in the Baiags’ settlement by the lake Big Mere anyone can get a fantastic meal in exchange for a utility item or a small service.
