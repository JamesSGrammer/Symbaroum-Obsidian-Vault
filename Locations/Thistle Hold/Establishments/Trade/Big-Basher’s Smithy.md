- Owner: Big-Basher (Ogre) Master Smith
- Sells: Weapons & armor. Does custom orders.

The ogre Big-Basher came walking out of Davokar before the palisade of Thistle Hold was finished. Famished and unable to make himself understood, he was perceived as an onrushing threat and had it not been for the barbarian blacksmith Hurela he would most likely have been killed that day. Instead he was taken in by Hurela who immediately put him to work, first for working the bellows, later as an assistant at the anvil and finally as the maker of weapons and armor parts. When the Master died from acute respiratory failure a few years ago, Basher inherited the smithy and no one doubts that he also has succeeded his “mother” as the finest blacksmith in the Hold. Aside from the owner himself, two novices, one adept and three goblins work in the shop – the latter ones claimed to be the most privileged Karabbadokks in town. The goblins handle the bellows, shuffle coal and greet customers, always with a welcoming, pointy-toothed grin. The adept Vania crafts appliances of standard quality and sometimes even the novices perform well enough for their creations to be sold. But if you want weapons or armor of really high standard you have to order them directly from the master smith himself (see the rule Mastercraft, page 76). The items take longer to make and cost more, but on the other hand they can mean the difference between life and death when facing the horrors of Davokar.
