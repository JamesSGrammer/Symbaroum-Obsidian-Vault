The creature exudes harmful energies that each turn deal damage to everyone within melee range. Also, the creature leaves clear marks in its wake, in the form of a burnt, frozen or otherwise warped trail through the environment. Hence, all attempts to track the creature automatically succeed.
The aura can consist of fire, cold, acid or lightning. Together with the trait [[Alternative Damage]] the aura affects the chosen Attribute instead of Toughness, but only if the creature has Alternative Damage to at least the same level as Harmful Aura. The aura can also be corrupting or poisonous instead, if the creature has the traits [[Corrupting Attack]] or [[Poisonous]] to the same level or higher.
