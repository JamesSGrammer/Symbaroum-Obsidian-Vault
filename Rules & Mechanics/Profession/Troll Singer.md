Singing as a source of power has its most evident expression in the troll singing skalds, whose voices lay mysteries bare and win battles. Poetry and singing exist in all cultures, but they are most powerful among elves, dwarves and trolls – with the possible addition of ogres. In all of these diverse cultures, singing is often combined with physical attributes – most skalds are true warrior poets that lead their allies to victory using the great power of their voice and muscles.
