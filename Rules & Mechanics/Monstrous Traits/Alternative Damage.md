The creature’s attack harms a specific Attribute instead of Toughness, usually Strong or Resolute. If not specified in the monster description, the Game Master decides which one. This kind of damage affects all rolls made using that Attribute. Alternative Damage heals, and can be healed, just like ordinary damage. If the Attribute reaches 0, the victim’s soul or life force is devoured by the attacker and the victim dies. Alternative Damage requires the monstrous trait Spirit Form
