**Tradition**: Symbolism 
The mystic creates a personal guard from a statue of stone or wood, carved with life-giving and loyalty building runes. The creator of the guardian can instill some of its own experience into the statue, to make the being stronger upon creation.
The Rune Guardian is handled like a second character of the player; it gains Experience and develops over time. The guardian does not sleep and has a simple personality, revolving around duty and obedience. If the guardian dies all acquired Experience is lost and the mystic must start over with a new guardian.
