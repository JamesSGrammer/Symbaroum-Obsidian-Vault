A creature’s Shadow reflects its increasing level of Corruption, and the Witchsight ability or the Holy Smoke ritual can be used reveal this. Technically, a corrupted creature has two Shadows, one representing its base color and one representing the taint.
The base Shadow is decided by the formula [Resolute –Corruption]; if this value is higher than the total Corruption value, then the base Shadow is the strongest and brightest of the two. The Corruption becomes the strongest Shadow when it reaches or exceeds the creature’s original Shadow. Should a creature’s total Corruption reach or exceed its value in the *[[Resolute]]* Attribute the creature is thoroughly corrupted and turned into an abomination.
