**Tradition**: Witchcraft

The mystic summons the dark spirits of retribution and binds them to an object, punishing anyone trying to steal or meddle with it. In doing so, one determines the conditions for triggering the effect â€“ usually the object being moved or damaged. The mystic himself/herself is exempt from triggering the punishment; as are other people who were present when the ritual was being performed. If the effect is triggered, everyone within a Movement Action's reach suffers 1d10 temporary corruption. Only the mystic who performed the ritual and those who are immune to its powers can dispel it, using the Break Link ritual.
