Power corrupts, and in Symbaroum quite literally so. A fundamental principle in Symbaroum is that when nature is cultivated or violated it grows dark and vengeful â€“ and strikes back! The darkness that comes alive in this way feeds off and can continue to infect its surroundings. Since Mystics bend and warp nature according to their will, they are constantly threatened by Corruption. And when looking at the ruleset, this principle is mirrored in the concept of Shadows and in creatures like abominations and the undead.
Corruption starts at zero (0) and grows as the character is tainted. A character is technically transformed into an abomination when its Corruption value exceeds its Resolute value. Yet, long before that, the character starts to show physical signs of its growing taint, in the form of Stigmas.
