The different traits that representatives of the playable races either have or can have. Some of the traits only have one level and come automatically with the selection of a race, at no additional cost in creation points. Others function and cost as abilities, aside from the fact that they are tied to a certain race. Such a trait is optional and the player decides whether or not to purchase it when creating the character.
