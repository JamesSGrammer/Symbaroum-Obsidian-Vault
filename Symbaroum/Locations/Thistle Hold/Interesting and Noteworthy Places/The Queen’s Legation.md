The eldest daughter of House Argona, a meticulous and educated widow named Suria, acts as the official legate of the Queen in Thistle Hold. The newly constructed legation is placed close to the fence of Nighthome and houses a staff of seven, entrusted to speak for Korinthia’s administration and to send daily reports on large and small matters back to Yndaros.
Suria’s father, the imposing Count Alkantor Argona, has come to spend more and more time on the upper floor of the building, a floor which he disposes of as if he owned it. Persistent rumors claim that he governs his daughter with an iron fist, and that she for her part is fully occupied by trying to cover up her father’s taste for all forms of lowly pleasures. Such gossip aside, there is no doubt that the Count often meets with the Mayor and the reason for that is commonly known: both have a lot to lose by the continued growth of Blackmoor, especially since the situation plays in favor of the unruly House Erebus and its charismatic leader, Baron Grafoldo.
