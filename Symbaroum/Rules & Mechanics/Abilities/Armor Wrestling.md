The player character is trained in using his/her armor to maximum effect. The ability can only be used with at least medium armor, but can be very effective, not least against armored opponents and when the user moves through the midst of a battle.

---
- Novice **Movement**. Wearing at least medium armor, the character has +1D6 in Armor against all enemy hits during the movement.
- Adept **Active**. Roll an attack test to grab and restrain an enemy until failing a [Strong←Strong] test. Each turn after the first, an attack with a Short weapon can be made; while restrained the enemy may only defend, and if hit Armor is ignored.
- Master **Active**. Roll an attack test to grab and with a following [Strong←Strong] test throw an enemy to the ground; the character lands on top (1D6 crushing damage, ignoring Armor). The character may then restrain and attack as on Adept level, aside from the enemy not being able to defend during the first turn after the throw.
