**Material**: A depiction of the runes
The mystic’s runes emit protective energies that surround the mystic and at higher levels also his or her allies.

---
- Novice **Active**. The power of the runes offers +1D4 to Armor until the mystic fails a Resolute test or loses concentration [Resolute Damage]. The extra die of Armor is rolled separately with each hit and is added to any other Armor.
- Adept **Active**. The runes provide +1D4 to Armor (see the novice level). A retaliating effect also inflicts 1D4 damage on every enemy that harms the protected creature, ignoring any Armor. The effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test or loses concentration [Resolute –Damage].
- Master **Active**. The protective and retaliating effects are rolled with 1D6 instead of 1D4, and it lasts until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
