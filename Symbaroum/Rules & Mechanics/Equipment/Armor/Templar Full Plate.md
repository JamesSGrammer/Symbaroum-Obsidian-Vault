The armor of the templars is a full plate forged, blessed and carried by the orderâ€™s inner circle. This elite among the elite inherit their armor from a predecessor that fell in battle or, more uncommonly, who died a solemn death in their alcove in Templewall. The armor gives its wearer the protection of Prios, through blessings forged into the steel and by the hallowing blood of both enemies and martyrs.
