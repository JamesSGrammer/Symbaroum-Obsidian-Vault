During The Great War there were deserters – many doubted that a victory over the Dark Lords was possible. To deal with the problem, King Ynedar, Queen Korinthias’s father, placed a permanent bounty on the heads of the runaways. In doing so, he indirectly founded the guild of the Bounty Hunters. The tradition to pay for having fugitives caught lives on and nowadays the bounty hunters are often forced to venture into the forest of Davokar, where the most desperate – and also most valuable – targets tend to seek refuge.

### Bounties
The following bounties can be collected in Ambria for a number of more or less common crimes. This only pertains to the bounty set by the Town Watch or equivalent; private bounties may also be posted by victims or their relatives. These private contributions can double and sometimes even increase a bounty by a factor of five or ten – making that particular target a much coveted prize!
