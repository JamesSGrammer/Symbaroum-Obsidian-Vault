**Tradition**: Only available to Mentalists
The higher level of the ritual [[Clairvoyance]] makes it possible for the mentalist to open a mystic tunnel to the location observed. By way of this tunnel, all mystical powers that do not require touching the target can be used. Also the allies of the mentalist can use the tunnel to affect the observed location with mystical powers. However, the tunnel goes both ways, so people on the far side may very well retaliate. Ranged weapons cannot fire projectiles through the tunnel; only powers and traits that work as powers are allowed. The Spell Tunnel is active during a scene but can be closed earlier with [[Anathema]].
