The wizards who specialize in twisting perception journey to the depths of the mind’s maze and return wiser and more powerful – provided that they do not get lost in the mirages and dream worlds; a factual danger for those exploring the possible and imaginable, rather than the real. On the other hand, some illusionists claim that their most unworldly colleagues are those with the greatest understanding of reality; that everything is a lie and that we are free to define what is really true. Aside from this strong solipsistic tendency there are illusionists who are very enlightened, firmly rooted in a cynical view of the world and the delusions of man, ready to utilize their abilities to the utmost while striving for their goals.
