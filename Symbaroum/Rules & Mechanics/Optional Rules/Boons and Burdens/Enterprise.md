The character owns some kind of establishment â€“ a small tavern, a smaller store or some other simple craft service like a cobbler or trinket shop. Other alternatives are a theater or a troop of acrobats. The enterprise can be stationary in a place often visited by the characters between adventures, or it can be mobile in the form of a wagon or a river boat if that feels more reasonable.
Once per adventure (or in-between adventures), the character may roll a Cunning (for artisans) or Persuasive (for services) test. A success renders a profit of 10+1d10 thaler, after all expenses have been paid. If more than one character has Enterprise, it can be parts of the same establishment or business. If so, both characters roll a profit test each.
