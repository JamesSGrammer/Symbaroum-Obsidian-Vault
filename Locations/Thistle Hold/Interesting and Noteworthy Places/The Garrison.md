The town watch of Thistle Hold is both numerous and well-paid. The one hundred fifty guards are divided into three shifts but can in times of trouble be amassed in full strength. When that happens they make a formidable fighting unit, not least because they are led by a trio of very experienced officers. The captains Tallios, Marvello and Dekamedo are, like most of their subordinates, veterans of The Great War, where they all acted as commanders in densely populated areas. To suppress unrest, lecture mischief-makers and predict where trouble will arise are their specialties.
According to persistent rumors the town watchâ€™s only real problem is that its commandant lacks much of the commitment shown by its captains. Herado Duskwatcher is the younger brother of Mayor Nightpitch, and it is said that he was awarded his position only because Lasifor wanted a commandant he could trust and control. Much suggests that the temperamental and anxious Herado, a man with a velvet fist in an iron glove, may prove to be a liability if and when the town watch is tested for real.
