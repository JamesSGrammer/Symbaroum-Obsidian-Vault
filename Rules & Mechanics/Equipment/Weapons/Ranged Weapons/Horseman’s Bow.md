During The Great War the need for a powerful bow that could be used by mounted warriors arose. The traditional longbow was too ungainly – it was so long that it interfered with the horse, or vice versa. To solve this, the asymmetrical horseman’s bow was developed.
The lower limb of the bow is shorter than the upper, allowing the bow to be maneuvered back and forth over the horse’s back without losing any of its punch. The weapon is tilted forward when it is aimed and fired, in order to maintain equal tension between the two limbs.
In Ambria, the horseman’s bow is primarily used in the west, against the forays of the wagon riding Saars. There, the traditional longbow companies are used as defensive troops, but in order to hunt the plunderers down riders are needed, preferably armed with bows.
