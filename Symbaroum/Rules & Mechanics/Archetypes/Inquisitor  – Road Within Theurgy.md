For some theurgs, whether among priests or Black Cloaks, the hatred of the dark is so strong that they choose the inquisitorâ€™s road: to seek out and destroy the enemies of Prios. Inquisitors are happy to cooperate with templars and other members of the church; they are not interested in understanding the darkness and tend to rely on cunning, ambushes and assassination to reach their goals, never brute force like the templars. To most inquisitors, sorcerers and their followers have no right to exist, and for that reason no moral consideration is necessary when they are fighting the dark.
