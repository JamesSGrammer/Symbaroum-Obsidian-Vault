It is believed that the elves of Davokar have always abducted human children and left changelings in their stead. Children taken by the elves are called Abductees, and the reasons for them being taken have varied. Initially it was to learn more about and better understand humans; later the motive changed to wanting to foster ambassadors who understood the elves and could live among the barbarians and teach them elven wisdom. Nowadays *(in the Elven sense, meaning the last century)*, there has been an increasing need for warriors within the Iron Pact – to replace elves fallen in battle, and to offset the growing number of elves that do not survive their first dormancy – the darkening of Davokar causes fewer and fewer elves to wake to their summer phase. Hence, it is not uncommon to see abducted humans hunt and fight alongside summer elves in the warbands of the Pact. The elves have long since known that abductees are loyal and good learners, but much to their surprise some of them have also proven capable of wisdom. Very few elves would ever admit this; to most elves the abducted humans are almost akin to faithful pets, useful and absolutely possible to love, but never to be regarded as equals.

### Abducted Human Names
The abductees are named by their foster parents, often in a way that sounds human to the elves and seldom with names consisting of more than two syllables. They should be easy to pronounce and remember, prefer ably also easy to roar if the need arises. Aside from that, the names often have more consonants than vowels and almost never two consonants in a row, just like Elven names.

### Abductees as Adventurers
Abducted Humans tend to leave the Iron Pact for the same reasons elves sometimes do – as mediators, scouts, exiled or avengers – but may also have a much more personal reason for becoming an adventurer:
**Runaway**: For some reason – curiosity, home-sickness, abuse – the abductee chooses to flee to the realm of humans, to become a special sort of stranger.
