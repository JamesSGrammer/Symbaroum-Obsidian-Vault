The creature has the ability to spew forth a harmful cascade, so powerful that it can obliterate enemies or at least damage them severely. The breath can consist of fire, cold, acid or lightning. Together with the trait Alternative Damage the cascade affects the chosen Attribute instead of Toughness, but only if the creature has Alternative Damage to at least the same level as Deadly Breath. The cascade can also be corrupting or poisonous instead, if the creature has the traits Corrupting Attack or Poisonous to the same level or higher.

---
- I **Action**: *Active*. The creature blows a cascade towards one target. If the target succeeds with a [Quick←Accurate] test, the damage is 3; if the test fails, the damage is 6.
- II **Action**: *Active*. The creature exhales a continuous cascade. Should the first target succeed with a [Quick←Accurate] test, the damage is 3; if the test fails, the damage is 6. If the target fails, the creature may redirect the cascade towards another target, and so on until a target succeeds with the [Quick←Accurate] test.
- III **Action**: *Active*. The creature spews forth a veritable storm. As II, but even if one target succeeds with the [Quick←Accurate] test, the chain continues and is not broken until a second target succeeds.
