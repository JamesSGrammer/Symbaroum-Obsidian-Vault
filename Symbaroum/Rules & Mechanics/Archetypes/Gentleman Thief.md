Some thieves go one step further than most in terms of flair: to strike without violence and without leaving a trace is not enough for the Gentleman Thieves; they also expect themselves to be able to perform their crimes with finesse. To top things off they often leave some kind of symbol behind – a particular flower, a playing card or a poem composed for the particular victim – to signal who is behind the otherwise inexplicable theft. Some gentleman thieves do not even steal valuables, others steal nothing at all – to them getting into a highly guarded area and leaving their symbol is quite enough.
Gentleman Thieves are among the elite of the thief guilds in Yndaros. Sometimes they are bored nobles who do not need to steal but find it entertaining and thrilling; more often they are of modest breed, longing for a grander life than they can hope to achieve – a life they simultaneously mimic and take revenge on, in their own poetic way.
