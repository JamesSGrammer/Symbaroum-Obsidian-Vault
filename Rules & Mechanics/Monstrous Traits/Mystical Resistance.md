The creature has a natural resistance against the effects of mystical powers. Basically, it is more difficult to harm or affect by mystical means, and on higher levels there is also a risk that the energies directed against it are reflected to hit someone else.

---
- I **Action**: *Passive*. All who try to affect or harm the creature with mystical powers must roll the success test twice and pass both times in order for the power to take effect. 
- II **Action**: *Passive*. As I, but if the success test fails, the power is redirected towards a randomly selected target within sight of the creature. Aside from the attacking mystic suffering from any temporary corruption, the reflected power works as if the creature knew it and had used it against the randomly selected target. 
- III **Action**: *Passive*. As II, but the resilient creature has such control that it may choose which target the power is reflected towards.
