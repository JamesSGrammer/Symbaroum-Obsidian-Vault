**Tradition:** Symbolism 
**Material:** A symbol created for the purpose 
The mystic binds banishing energies to a symbol, that when unleashed sweeps out in waves over the area. Upon creation, the mystic must choose what type of creature will be affected (Abominations, Beasts, Cultural Beings or Undead).

---
- Novice **Active**. The symbol triggers a chain of banishing energies. The target closest to the symbol is affected if the mystic passes a [Resolute‚ÜêResolute] test; if this succeeds, an attempt is made to banish the next enemy and so on, until a test fails. Banished creatures must leave the area as quickly as they can and may not return before the end of the scene.
- Adept **Active**. Same as the novice level, but creatures that are unaffected (the test fails) suffer 1D4 damage from the power, ignoring Armor. Targets that are unaffected by the banishing effect can choose to flee to avoid being damaged; if so, they may not return until after the scene.
- Master **Active**. Same as the novice level, but those that are not banished suffer 1D8 damage, ignoring Armor. Targets that are unaffected by the banishing effect can choose to flee instead and only suffer 1D4 damage, ignoring Armor; if so, they may not return until after the scene.
