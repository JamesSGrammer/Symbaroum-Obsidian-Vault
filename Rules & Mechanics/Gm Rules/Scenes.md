Scenes form the basis of gameplay and can be compared to scenes in a movie: one location, a couple of characters and something important that happens (a challenge). The duration of many abilities and powers lasts for an entire scene.
Scenes can be started by both players and Game Masters â€“ a Game Master may introduce the characters to a challenge and the players can have their characters perform actions which make the game world respond in a challenging way.
For a situation to count as a scene, it has to include a challenge and, hence, an element of risk or cost to the player characters. The game mechanic for Experience relies on the number of scenes a player character survives.
