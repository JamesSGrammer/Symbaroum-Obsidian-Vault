The attacks of the creature are powerful enough to throw enemies to the ground. The mightiest of wreckers are even capable of acting as living battering rams, crushing gates, razing towers and toppling walls with their natural weapons.

- I **Action**: Reaction. The creature’s attacks can knock enemies that take damage prone. The target avoids the fall if it passes a [Strong←Strong] test, where each level in the Robust trait gives +2 on Strong for both attacker and defender. 
- II **Action**: Reaction. As I, but enemies that take damage are at risk of being thrown. If the target fails its test against [Strong←Strong], he or she is thrown 1D6 meters back and suffers damage as if from a fall from the corresponding height. A thrown enemy lands flat on its back. 
- III **Action**: Passive. The brutal attacks of the creature gain the quality Wrecking (see page 118 in the Advanced Player’s guide).
