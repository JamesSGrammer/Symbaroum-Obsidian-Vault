After having marched many, many miles in military columns or through the wilds, the player character does not have to make a test to endure walking at Death March speed. Damage also heals as normal during Forced Marches. The expertise of the character benefits those around him or her, and all traveling companions get a second chance to endure the strain of walking at Death March speed. Furthermore, they may roll a Strong test to see if they heal naturally during a Forced March.
