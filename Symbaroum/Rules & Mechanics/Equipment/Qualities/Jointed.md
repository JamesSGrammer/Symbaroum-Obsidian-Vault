The weapon is jointed, letting the head of the weapon strike past or around blocking weapons or shields, making it harder to parry. The length of the chain also makes the attacks difficult to evade. Even if a parry is successful, the attack hits if the die lands on an odd number; in which case the weapon deals 1D6 damage. This secondary damage is not affected by any abilities – it remains 1D6 regardless of the attacker’s other abilities.
