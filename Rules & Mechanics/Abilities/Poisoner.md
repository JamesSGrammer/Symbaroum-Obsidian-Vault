Davokar hides many alchemically potent and poisonous plants, and the character is familiar with the effective use of poisoned weapons in combat. Poisons can be purchased from less scrupulous peddlers, but to actually brew a poison requires some understanding of alchemy (the Alchemy ability). 
The Poisoner ability can be used to identify different poisons or the effect of a poison on a wounded or dead person.

---
- Novice **Free**. As a free action, the character can apply one dose of poison or any other alchemical elixir to a weapon. That one dose of poison is enough for one hit with the weapon before more of the poison must be applied. A [Cunning←Strong] test is needed for the poison to take effect; if successful the victim starts to take damage. The damage suffered per turn and the duration of the poison depends on its strength (see page 153).
- Adept **Free**. As novice, but the character under stands how to make a dose of poison last an entire battle. After applying a dose, all attacks counts as poisonous for the duration of the combat scene.
- Master **Free**. The character has mastered the art of poisoning and knows how to get the most out of a poison. If the character succeeds with a Cunning test, any poison applied to a weapon counts as one level higher than usual. Weak poison counts as Moderate, Moderate counts as Strong. Strong poison does not deal any additional damage but gives the character a second chance to succeed with the [Cunning←Strong] test instead.
