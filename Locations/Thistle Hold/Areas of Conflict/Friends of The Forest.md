That the subjects of Queen Korinthia are charmed by the wild might of Davokar is not as uncommon as one might think. One flagrant example was exposed the other year when the authorities caught up with a secret society called the Jakaars â€“ led by a novice of the Order named Hurelia and consisting of about twenty individuals who only have one thing in common: an abhorrence of how their fellow countrymen were treating the forest.
The Jakaars were no cult; they were in no way allied to the dark and corrupt forces of Davokar. But they were far from toothless. Up to the point of their capture they had only carried out a few minor attacks, but they had plans to cause problems for everyone exploiting the woods as well as those who trade in the loot of treasure-hunters and explorers. One might wonder just how they were hoping to accomplish this without attracting suspicions from witchhunters or becoming directly involved in occult activities.
