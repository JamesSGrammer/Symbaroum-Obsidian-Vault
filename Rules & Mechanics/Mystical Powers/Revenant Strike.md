**Tradition**:
Material: A weapon tainted by a Desecrating Rite. 
The mysticâ€™s weapon is touched by dark energies, which increases the damage dealt against living creatures. Worse, those slain will rise again, as walking corpses controlled by the sorcerer. Undead created by revenant strikes have the same statistics as the dragoul (see page 230). The undead returns to its state of true death at the end of the scene.

---
- Novice Active. The sorcerer ignites a malicious flame around its melee weapon, which then deals 1D4 additional damage till the scene ends.
- Adept Active. As novice, and creatures slain by the Revenant Strike rise again the following turn, loyal to the sorcerer.
- Master Active. As adept, but the unholy weapon deals 1D8 additional damage, instead of the 1D4 at novice level.
