The character is a talented musician and possibly trained in the art of singing and playing an instrument. He can give himself or his group of allies a +1 bonus on all Persuasive tests; every one likes to hear a good song. A musician’s skills can even save the character’s life, as a beautiful voice and the sound of well-tuned strings can calm members of the monster cate gory Beasts – if no one threatens the creature, a [Persuasive←Resolute] test will stop it from attacking. The character and its allies may then back away and find another route forward. Musician can be acquired multiple times, up to a maximum bonus of +3 on relevant tests.
