*Resolute* represents a character’s resistance to influence, whether it is social pressure, mind-bending magic or *Corruption*. *Resolute* is also tied to the use of mystical powers. The Attribute is often opposed by either an enemy’s *[[Resolute]]* or *[[Persuasive]]*. Note that having a very low value in this Attribute is inadvisable, because of the risk for *Corruption*.
