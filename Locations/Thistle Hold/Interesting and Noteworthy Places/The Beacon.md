The lives of nine goblins and three ogres were lost in the construction of the miraculous light tower that looms about three hundred feet above the Toad’s Square. The fire which blazes at its top is fed oil from a shelf fifty feet below; a shelf serving as a lookout post for the Queen’s Rangers. The soldiers stationed up there are also tasked with stopping the many ruined and hopeless people in town from using the platform as a gate to the peaceful beyond.
The massive tower has become something of a symbol for the Ambrian struggle to tame the wilds, and the wardens of Davokar appear to have declared it their primary target. Only taking the latest year into account, three attempts have been made to burn it to the ground. In all three cases the attacks were carried out by unscrupulous citizens on the brink of ruin who had been bribed into action. Who paid them is not known, but according to the rumor mill the answer is obvious: the gold came from the witches or the elves, alternately from the human-hating alliance they both are believed to be part of.
