In Symbaroum, movement is an abstract thing; a movement is more of a meaningful Action rather than meant to symbolize a specific distance. Some groups may prefer a Move Action to be determined by scale, usable with miniatures on a grid or crosses on a checkered paper. If so, it is our recommenda tion that a Movement Action represents 5 squares (2 paces or 2 meters per square). Creatures that stand next to each other are engaged in melee combat, and ranged attacks are required if there are one or more squares between the combatants.
The advantages of Movement by Scale is that it is easy to see which characters are engaged in melee com bat, who will get a Free Attack when someone passes by and who has an open line of sight. The disadvantages is that it takes more time to plan and may mean a small loss of dramatic effect, since exciting combat is transformed into more of a mathematical exercise.
