In Thistle Hold there is a huge selection of dives, dens and finer taverns where the townsfolk can appease their various needs and wants.
But among these establishments the Salons of Symbaroum has earned itself a special status. You may get the best tenderized deer steak at Afadir’s Triumph Tavern, the sweetest syrup beer at Brew and the best gaming odds at Benego’s, but only under the roof of Ordelia Wildjoice do all these pleasures come together.
The Salons of Symbaroum, or “the Salons” for short, offer three stories of pure delight and two of the dirtier kind – the visitors may eat, drink, gamble, enjoy exotic shows or pay for entrance to the top floor where they can appease various carnal desires. However, the latter is only an option during six out of seven days. What happens up there on the seventh is not commonly known, but there are three main rumors: meticulous cleaning, sessions with special guests or occult rites led by Ordelia herself.
