The creature has multiple heads or limbs governed by separate brains/minds, and can use them independently of each other. Damage is suffered separately by each part, as if they were separate creatures, so they have to be taken out one by one. Only once all are eliminated does the creature die.
A drawback is that the traits Armored and Robust are weakened at the higher levels of Many-headed: such a massive and simultaneously limber body cannot fully utilize all its protection and strength in all directions at once.
