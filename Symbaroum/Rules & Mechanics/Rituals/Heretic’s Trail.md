Tradition: Theurgy
With a successful Resolute test the mystic can track an abomination or a tainted creature that the mystic has met personally. The tracking is impeccable until the blighted one crosses water â€“ if it does, the ritual must be performed again on the far side of the stream. Should the test fail, the mystic cannot try again until the next day. Also, it is harder to track blight-stricken creatures within larger settlements and in Davokar, giving the mystic a second chance of failing the test; the player must roll twice and if one of those fails, so does the ritual.
