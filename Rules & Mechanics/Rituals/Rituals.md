Rituals are Time-consuming spells that take at least one hour to perform. If properly used, a ritual can be a powerful problem-solving tool. Each tradition has developed a variety of distinctive practices and it can be difficult for members of other traditions to acquire the knowledge of specific rituals.
Like powers, rituals can cause Corruption; first when they are learned and then each time they are used. Each tradition has developed their own way of handling Corruption that comes from the use of rituals, just like with the Corruption originating from using powers. Independent mystics lack the appropriate schooling and are therefore in an especially tough spot when it comes to suffering Corruption from all forms of mystical practices.
