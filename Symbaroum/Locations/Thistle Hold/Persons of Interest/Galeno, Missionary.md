Galeno is twenty-six years old and does not remember much about where he grew up, not more than the dust from the sterile soils and the daily hunts for clean water. And the refugee camp at Yndaros was not much more uplifting, especially not after his father died from consumption and his mother abandoned him for a new man with cold eyes and the dreams of a fortune-hunter. He was taken into the care of a charitable sun priest who sent him to the convent school where he was taught to revere Prios, the One.
Galeno studied diligently. He read anything he came across, searching for phrases resounding with the charity of his adoptive father. But he never found anything but rules as cold as the mother-thief’s eyes, passages arguing that might is right and all-encompassing demands for an unconditional, self-destructive worship of the One. Then he heard about Father Sarvola …
Two months later he had left Yndaros and resumed his studies at the missionary station in Thistle Hold, determined to spread the love of Prios to illiterate goblins as well as to those hunting for fortunes in bottles of blackbrew. So far he has not received much more than a handful of beatings in return, but he will never give up. His dream is to journey far into the woods, and to find one of the many goblin tribes dwelling there, naturally in the hope of converting them to followers of Prios. As soon as he has found a suitable escort he is off.
