**Tradition**: Wizardry
The mystic can stretch out its mind and read thoughts. The mystic can receive an answer to a yes/no question from the victim’s subconscious by making a successful [Resolute←Resolute] test. A failed test severs the telepathic connection and no further attempts can be made with that creature during the adventure. The mystic must touch its victim, and the victim can notice the mind-reading if the mystic fails a [Discreet←Vigilant] test. Of course, a helpless and bound victim can do nothing to stop this, but other victims will react. Sleeping victims wake up if the test fails.
