One of the most storied heroes of early Symbaroum is the warrior Loravana, commander of Queen Serala-Han Urel’s armed forces. Under her leadership, the Queen’s petty kingdom in the north seized more and more land, which is why some legends name her the true mother of the unified Symbaroum. If this is true, it would also explain why her legendary shield remained in the hands of the Symbarian emperors.

**Shield Throw**: If the person bound to Loravana’s throwing shield also has the Steel Throw ability, the artifact can be flung as a throwing weapon for 1d8 damage. It then automatically returns to its master’s arm and may be used to parry attacks immediately after the throw.

**Power Bash**: If the shield’s master has the Shield Fighter ability at Adept level or higher, he or she can put more force into each shield bash. A power bash increases the maneuver’s damage to 1d8 and adds +5 to Strong in any attempt at knocking down the enemy.
