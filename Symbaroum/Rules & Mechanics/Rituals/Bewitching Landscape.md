**Tradition**: Wizardry
The mystic can weave a grand illusion over a location, making all who enter the area confused, lost and at risk of starving to death if they cannot break the spell. The mystic enthralls every creature in the area with a passed [Resolute‚ÜêCunning] test; the victims gain a second chance to break the spell if one of their companions passes the test and then rolls a successful Persuasive test. The effect can temporarily be dispelled with [[Anathema]]; otherwise it can only be permanently broken by the mystic who wove the illusion.
