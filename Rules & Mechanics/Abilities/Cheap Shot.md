In the slums of Alberetor’s larger cities, special techniques for self-defense emerged. These techniques are still practiced among the gangs of Yndaros.

---
- Novice **Active**. Cheap Shots like a “gutter-kiss” (head-butt) or a “goblin-squeeze” (groin kick) comes naturally to the character in stressful situations. Such an attack deals 1D6 damage, and if the opponent is dam aged the character also gains a Free Attack against him or her.
- Adept **Reaction**. The character performs a normal melee attack and if it deals damage, he or she adds a trip or a tackle. Such a maneuver knocks the opponent to the ground if the character succeeds with a [Cunning←Quick] test.
- Master **Reaction**. Every enemy who engages the character in melee suffers a bloody riposte dealing 1D6 damage directly after its attack. The riposte always hits a weak spot and consequently ignores any armor.
