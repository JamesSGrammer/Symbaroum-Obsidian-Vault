Some mystics know how to project their will to form a psychic weapon that can attack the enemy together with the mystic’s ordinary melee attacks. This means that the enemy must defend on two fronts, and risk failing at both. There is also a chance that the enemy will be paralyzed or severely damaged by the psychic thrust.

---
- Novice **Reaction**. The mystic performs a normal melee attack in combination with a psychic thrust, aimed at the enemy’s defensive capability. The character gains a second chance to succeed on the attack test.
- Adept **Reaction**. The psychic thrust is made in combination with the melee attack, and if the mystic passes a [Resolute←Resolute] test the enemy is incapable of defending against the attack. Hence, if this test is successful, the mystic automatically hits the enemy.
- Master **Reaction**. With a successful test against [Resolute←Resolute] the enemy is unable to defend and the melee attack hits automatically. Moreover, the enemy suffers 1D4 extra damage, ignoring Armor, in addition to the damage dealt by the melee attack.
