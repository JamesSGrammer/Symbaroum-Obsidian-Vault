**Only available to Wrath Guard**
The witches on Karvosti understand the power of the blood better than others. These insights have been developed in cooperation with the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath. The dedication and training of the guard allows them to use the power of spilled blood to their own advantage in combat – whether the blood is theirs or the enemy’s.

---
- Novice **Reaction**. The character draws strength from the blood it spills. When his or her Toughness has been halved, the character gains a second chance to succeed with all attack tests in melee combat.
- Adept **Reaction**. The character’s hits grow more powerful the more damaged he or she is; when Toughness has been more than halved, all attacks made by the character in melee combat deal an additional +1D8 in damage.
- Master **Reaction**. The warrior is healed by the blood spilled by the enemy; half of the damage that the character deals in melee combat is added to the character’s Toughness, rounded down.
