The mystic can surround itself with an aura of unholy energies that harms living enemies but heals abominations and undead

---
- Novice Active. With a successful Resolute test the mystic can send out an aura of unholy energies that harms both cultural beings and beasts. It deals 1D6 damage, ignoring Armor. The aura affects all cultural beings and beasts within sight of the mystic, whether they are friend or foe, and remains active until the mystic fails a Resolute test or breaks concentration.
- Adept Active. As novice level, but the mystic can choose to exclude living allies from the effect of the Unholy Aura. The power is active until the mystic fails a Resolute test.
- Master Active. As adept, but the effect is increased to 1D8 and any nearby allied abominations and undead heal 1D8 points of Toughness due to the spell's unholy energies
