The rules for boons and burdens are optional and each gaming group must decide whether it adds something positive to the game or not. If put into play, these rules will primarily affect the way characters are created and developed. Boons can be bought for 5 Experience each. Hence, a novice level ability – worth 10 Experience – may be switched for two boons when the player character is created. Burdens will instead add 5 extra Experience, to be used for acquiring one boon or saved for the future (or for re-rolls, if the optional rule Re-roll for Experience is used). Another option is to choose two burdens and trade them for a novice level ability. It is recommended that a character does not have more than two to three boons and one or two burdens –after that, the character quickly becomes more difficult, rather than more fun, to play.
