With the renaissance of artifact crafting, lesser artifacts have become available for purchase. These items are not necessarily more potent than alchemical elixirs, but are often of a more permanent kind. If a lesser artifact is of a disposable character (like all elixirs are), it will also require that the user has a certain ability. Some lesser artifacts are tightly linked to a mystical tradition or a mystical power and of little use in more general terms, but many of them can be used by anyone and are sure to be a welcomed addition to the tools and equipment of any treasure hunter venturing into Davokar.
