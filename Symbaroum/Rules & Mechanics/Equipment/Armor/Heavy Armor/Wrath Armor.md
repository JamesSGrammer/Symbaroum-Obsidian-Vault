The reinforced chainmail worn by the warriors in the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath has vengeful mystical energies forged into the rings. The retributive incantations, according to legend created by the huldra Bovosin more than four centuries ago, give the steel its characteristic blood-red shade â€“ as if the warriors just came from the scene of a tough battle, painted in the blood of their enemies.
