The hunters and their toil are of great importance, both for the Ambrians and among the clans of the forest. To commoners in Ambria, they may not appear to be any different from your average rogue, but for many (especially among those living close to Davokar) they are on par with true heroes. Covered in the dirt of the wilds, eyes shining with the light of the future, the hunters are vital in the project of cultivating and taming the great forest.
Among both Ambrians and barbarians, the hunters are often signified by their skillful use of ranged weapons and techniques. Exactly how they fight is primarily decided based on what they are hunting: criminals, monsters or dark-minded sorcerers. But no matter the target, what unites the hunters is a highly developed sense for where the prey has been, how it moves and to where it is headed – a sense that with near supernatural precision is captured by the archetypical ability they all may learn, called [[Hunter’s Instinct]].

### Hunters and The Races
All races have their hunters, but in general it is primarily elves, abducted humans and humans that excel in the area. Still, in Thistle Hold you may very well come across goblins and even a few ogres known as trustworthy guides through the wilds. Dwarves are seldom hunters in the forest, but some of Ambria’s most widely known bounty hunters are dwarves who for some reason have left their families in Yndaros.

### Hunter Attributes
Hunters are known to have keen senses ([[Vigilant]]) and be light on their feet ([[Discreet]]), as well as fast and agile ([[Quick]]). More versatile hunters have developed a skill to use just about any kind of weapon ([[Accurate]]), but a majority tends to use some single type of ranged weapon, maybe complemented by traps or poison ([[Cunning]]).
