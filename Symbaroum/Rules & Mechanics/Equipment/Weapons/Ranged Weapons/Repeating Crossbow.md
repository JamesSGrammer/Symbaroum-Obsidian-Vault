The repeating crossbow is a mechanically advanced version of the crossbow. The weapon has a push lever underneath, for quicker reloading. Only the most skilled blacksmiths are able to construct such technically advanced weaponry. A repeating cross bow is reloaded as a free action, without losing the striking power of the regular crossbow.
