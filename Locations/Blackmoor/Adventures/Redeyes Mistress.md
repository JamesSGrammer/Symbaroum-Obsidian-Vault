The lame, hunch-backed and red-eyed Galamar has many reasons for being generous and loving. Not that his current life in Blackmoor is so fantastic, but because things would become even worse if he did not make an effort to make friends. Why? Well, simply because it is up to Redeye to care for his blight born mother, Ragama. The swelling abomination lies in a pit below Galamar’s tent, imbued with an insatiable appetite for lukewarm, human flesh. The cavity is hidden by a wooden hatch, which in turn is covered by a sloppily crafted floor of planks, and every night Galamar has to convince some unfortunate inhabitant of the tent camp to embrace death by falling into the dark. If unsuccessful, some intoxicants and a discreet nudge usually do the trick. The real problem is that Ragama is no longer con tent to just survive – she desires to be worshipped. With the help of Galamar a new cult is growing, made up of blight marked humans and goblins that would do anything for the abomination. More and more of the camp’s outcasts are joining, searching for a mission in life and a reassurance that their blighted souls still have some kind of value. If no one puts a stop to it all, it will not take long before the cult is strong enough to make a grab for power in Blackmoor.
