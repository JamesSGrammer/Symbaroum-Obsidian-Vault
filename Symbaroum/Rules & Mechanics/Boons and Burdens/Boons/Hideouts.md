Many organizations and networks regularly establish hideouts in Ambria and the outer regions of Davokar; guilds and factions like witches, the Queen’s Rangers and most barbarian clans maintain such places for their members. The character knows of, and has access to, a series of such hideouts, linked to a specific group. There he or she can lay low and replace or acquire vital equipment, including weapons and armor.
When the character needs a hideout, he or she rolls a Cunning test – a success means that the char acter recalls the location of a place in the vicinity. The location is hidden, safe and contains equipment to a value of 10 thaler; the character decides what is kept in the hideout, items and/or coins. He or she who takes something from a hideout is expected to replace it later, or at least report what was taken and for what purpose.
