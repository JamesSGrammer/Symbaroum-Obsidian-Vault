The collective gains mystical powers when enough members are gathered closely together; the more members, the mightier their collective power, up to a certain limit (see Table 6 on page 166). The collective can perform one mystical power per turn, in addition to the actions of its individual members. If differences exist, this action is activated on the highest individual initiative of the collective. The power works as usual, but its collective origin makes it harder for the enemy to break the concentration of the caster – three of the collective's members has to lose concentration during the same turn for it to have an effect on the ongoing power.
