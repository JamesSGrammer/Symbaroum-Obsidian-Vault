Aside from his companion Yagaba and a staff of servants, Mayor Lasifor Nightpitch lives alone in a wooden palace called Nighthome. The building, three stories high, stands atop a softly sloping, grass-clad hill encircled by a man-high fence. The only other building on the plot stands by the fence gate, and is occupied by the Mayor’s personal guard.
The rumors swirling about Nighthome and what can be found within are of course many. There is talk of vaults full of gold, walls draped in antique tapestries and facial masks, and not least of the miraculous herbs growing on the roof terrace – for example the moonlight-loving Nightrose and the Silverlily that emanates sweet sugar-sap. But aside from the witch and the servants only a few select people have been allowed to see more of the building than the Mayor’s ground floor office. Great caution is taken, since Nighthome must be considered every burglar’s most coveted target.
