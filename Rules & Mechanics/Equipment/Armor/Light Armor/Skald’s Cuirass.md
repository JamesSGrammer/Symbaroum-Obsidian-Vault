Troll singers are often warrior poets and many carry a flexible armor of woven cloth- or leather-strips, strengthened with protective harmonies. The Skald’s Cuirass is durable without hampering the wearers’ movement, making it popular among other groups as well. For instance, wealthy duelists in Yndaros often color their cuirasses in personal colors, so that they can be recognized from afar.
