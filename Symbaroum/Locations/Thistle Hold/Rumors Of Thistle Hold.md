”The fortune hunter Mireda died some days ago. She owned a house at the intersection Thistle Street and Pitch Street which is full of hidden valuables. If you are quick, you can get there and loot the building before Mayor Nightpitch has signed the order to confiscate the lot!”

”Beneath Ordo Magica’s tower are dungeons where the wizards keep all sorts of horrors – an enslaved goblin tribe, a nest of etterherds and a blight born Aboar that has almost broken free on a number of occasions. And treasure. Untold treasure!”


”Queen Korinthia was killed by the Dark Lords. In fact, the Dark Lord himself has taken her place. Hence the mask on her face, the completely covering garments and the disguised voice. I’ve heard she speaks in the voice of a child!”

”The age-old cauldron hanging over the fireplace at the Ruin Inn is actually a helmet belonging to the arch troll Oxvog. The troll still lives and would no doubt reward whoever returned the powerful artifact to him."

”Did you hear that the Beast Clan has attacked a woodcutting camp north of Karabbadokk? They say it’s Karits in disguise but that’s goblin dung! My cousin has met a survivor of an alleged beast clan attack and he swears that the attackers were elves – thoroughly corrupt, blight-marked elves …”

”The top tower room at Arkerio’s Guest House is haunted by a wraith. Since the opening, only one single person has been able to stay there for a whole night. Can’t remember his name, but now he is tremendously wealthy, because he swallowed his fear and was awarded with the ghost’s secrets.”

”I have a friend who’s an explorer and his friend, who also is an explorer, was part of an expedition that captured an elf, alive and kicking. They tortured the elf to gain information about the hideouts of its people but were answered: ‘the road to the halls of a thousand tears is closed to all but the invited’. Then the beast bled out.”

”Cultists – you know people who ally with the Evils of Davokar in exchange for dark gifts – are everywhere. I’ve been told, by those I trust, that many nobles are involved in secret societies that worship the darkness. You must agree that Duke Gadra mei in Kastor seems like a shady figure …”

”You haven’t heard it from me, but the theurgs of the temple are insane. They plan to murder the Queen and all her vassals, and turn Ambria into the realm of Prios. Father Elfeno is one of the conspiracy’s leaders and I’ll bet there’s proof of his involvement at the Sun Temple!

”They say that the Blood-Daughter is reborn, the beastly God dess of Saar-Kahn. This is of course ludicrous but if the Saars them selves are convinced, it may mean they are about to become even more aggressive – bad news for us and the other clans …”

”I swear, the Iron Pact has lots of agents in the Hold! There are even humans in the service of the elves, genuine traitors! It wouldn’t surprise me if Faraldo, the antique dealer, is one of them – his store is always full of Symbarian artifacts!”
