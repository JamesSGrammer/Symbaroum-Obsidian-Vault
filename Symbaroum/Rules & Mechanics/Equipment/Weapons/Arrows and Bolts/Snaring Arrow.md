A barbed arrowhead and a thin silk thread attached to the arrow make it possible to ensnare a target using this projectile. Pulling it out takes a movement action and requires a passed [Strong –Damage] test; if successful the target suffers 1d4 damage but the arrow is out. Moving around with a snaring arrow imbedded in one’s flesh deals 1 damage per turn, ignoring armor.
