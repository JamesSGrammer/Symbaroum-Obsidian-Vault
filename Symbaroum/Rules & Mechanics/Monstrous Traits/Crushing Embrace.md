The creature’s natural weapons allow it to grip, hold on to and crush its enemies.

---
- I **Action**: *Reaction*. When the creature deals damage with its natural weapon, it may try to take hold of the enemy. To avoid being caught, the target must successfully roll a [Quick←Accurate] test. If the tar get fails it must succeed with a [Strong←Strong] test to get loose, or suffer 2 damage each turn as the grip tightens (ignoring Armor). A gripped target may not act, but the creature also loses one combat action per turn and gripped victim.
- II **Action**: *Reaction*. As I, but the damage is 3 per turn. 
- III **Action**: *Reaction*. As I, but the damage is 4 per turn.
