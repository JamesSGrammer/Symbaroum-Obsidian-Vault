The weapon is instilled with storming, thunderous energies. Each hit echoes with the powers of light ning and deals 1d8 damage, rolled separately from the normal damage caused by the attack. Abilities do not add to this extra damage effect. If any of the damage from this quality penetrates the armor the target also has to pass a *[[Strong]]* test or lose an action because of the force unleashed by the Thundering hit.
