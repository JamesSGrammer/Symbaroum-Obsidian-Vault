Everything needed for mounting an expedition into Davokar can be bought in the Hold. The general store Marvalom’s specializes in equipment for treasure-hunters and explorers but can keep prices that are about 20 percent above normal because of its legendary status. Within the walls there are also Marvalom’s competitor the Rope and Axe and the discount market in the Queen’s Square, where brand new objects share tables with secondhand items.
If you are looking for a real bargain you should visit Blackmoor, in particular the Marketplace or the store called Kodomar’s Huckery. But the noise, crowds and criminal elements of the tent camp are avoided by most, especially when taking the varying quality of the wares into account. In Blackmoor you can pay less than nothing for a masterly crafted item one day, and wind up paying a fortune the next for a pickaxe made from porous bog iron.
