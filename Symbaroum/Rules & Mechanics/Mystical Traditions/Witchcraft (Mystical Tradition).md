The witches’ world is composed of winds, blood and all things growing, together forming the three hazardous paths a witch has to wander: the white path where the wind wails and spirits howl; the red path of the slow-running blood; and the green path, overgrown by thickets and roots. According to the mythology of the witches, there are places where these three paths converge, such as the cliff of Karvosti deep within Davokar.
	Witchcraft is believed to be the oldest and most deeply rooted of the traditions.
Some tutors at Ordo Magica even claim that witchcraft – despite its primitive flaws – forms the basis of theurgy, and because of this, both theurgs and wizards have the wise witches of old to thank for understanding the fundamental principles of magic.

### The Titles of Witchcraft
Witches believe in independence, thus they are watchful of titles and hierarchal structures. The harsh living conditions of Davokar have resulted in each barbarian village housing a witch, and every witch is expected to have a helper (an apprentice). Furthermore, within each clan there is a witches’ node supervised by a Keeper, often called a Hex Mistress by southern scholars. All nodes convene at Karvosti, where the High Chieftain is advised by the Huldra, the foremost of all witches, whom outsiders generally call the Arch Witch.

### Powers
The chants of the witches include *[[Bend Will]], [[Curse]], [[Entangling Vines]], [[Inherit Wound]], [[Larvae Boil]], [[Lay on Hands]], [[Maltransformation]], [[Nature’s Embrace]], [[Shapeshift]]* and *[[Storm Arrow]]*.

### Rituals
The rituals of witchcraft are often performed as dances and include *[[Blood Bond]], [[Borrow Beast]], [[Familiar]], [[Nature’s Lullaby]], [[Necromancy]], [[Oracle]], [[Quick Growth]], [[Turn Weather]]* and *[[Witch Circle]]*.

### Corruption
For practitioners of witchcraft Corruption is viewed as nature’s way of seeking balance; what the witch does to the world strikes back against him or her. The Corruption must be weighed against the necessity of what the witch is about to do and be handled accordingly. Some witches will choose to sacrifice themselves to the Corruption in order to save their people; such is the fate of a witch according to the demands of life in the gloom of Davokar.
