**Price**: 5 [[Shilling]]
**Qualities**: [[Blood-letting]]
The head of this projectile is wide and meant to cause bleeding wounds. The downside is that it is less effective against armored targets. Targets get a +1d4 Armor bonus against the Swallowâ€™s Tail, but if damaged he or she will bleed like described in the quality Blood-letting.
