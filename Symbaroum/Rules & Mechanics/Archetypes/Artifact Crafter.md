The making of artifacts is a highly sought-after art form that for a long time was lost to elves and humans. However, among the trolls it has been kept alive, as an almost sacred practice. Lately, the knowledge has been revived by humans and elves, in both cases thanks to the trolls of Davokar. The elves received it as a gift from a former ally, to aid them in these dark days, but how Ordo Magica managed to get their hands on the lost art is not known. However it happened, the knowledge has spread so that every chapter soon will have at least one artifact crafter in its service.

### Artifact Crafting in Ordo Magica
The sudden reemergence of artifact crafting among wizards has made others question the source of the knowledge. One belief is that the Ambrian mystics have stolen it from the trolls – maybe even captured and tortured a troll – while others suspect that the rulers of the Underworld have traded this gift in exchange for something very valuable. What version lays closest to the truth is not easily guessed and the Grand Master refuses to speak on the topic.
