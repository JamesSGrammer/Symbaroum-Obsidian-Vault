The Movement Action represents a meaningful movement in combat. The Movement Action is done on a characterâ€™s Initiative. Normally, the exact distance is not of any great importance. What does matter in combat is who can make a melee attack and who can use ranged attacks.
If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces (10 meters), but characters who engage an enemy in melee combat naturally stop by the enemy if the distance is shorter than that (in other words, the character does not have to move the full 10 paces).

### Movement Actions are used to
- Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat.
- Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally.
- Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a *Free Attack*).
- Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free Attack.
- Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy.
### Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions
- Switch weapons
- Stand up from a prone position (requires a Quick test).
- Drink/apply an elixir to yourself.
