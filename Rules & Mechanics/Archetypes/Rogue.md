The Great war seems to be over, or it has at least taken a break. But the power struggle in Ambria continues in the shadows, a struggle that spreads into Davokar. The Queen’s Spies, commonly regarded as assassins with a more flattering name, are everywhere. In Yndaros, criminal guilds fight over the city’s resources, while a number of gentleman thieves fuel peoples’ fantasies about nobles who choose danger over boredom. Then there are the Sappers, armed with alchemical weapons and skilled in siege techniques that can make the enemy’s keep crumble – an art form that also comes in handy when establishing, or attacking, bases and outpost in Davokar. Finally there are the Cult Defectors, who have come to realize that they cannot take part in the deeds ordered by their former leaders. Of course, these defectors are pursued by both witchhunters and the friends they left behind. What rogues have in common is their versatility and quick counterattacks against those who try to force them in a certain direction or limit their freedom – the latter is captured by the archetypical ability [[Rapid Reflexes]].

### Rogues and The Races
Of the races introduced in the Advanced Player’s Guide, primarily dwarves and the undead are seen as likely rogues. In the case of dwarves, most Ambrians have only met or heard of the families residing in the capital, whose members seems to take pride in behaving like thugs. Regarding the undead, people from all positions and social strata are counted among them, but many of the afflicted tend to lead their wretched lives in the shadows – hoping to avoid becoming the target of some raging mob or a black cloak wanting to study their physiognomy.
