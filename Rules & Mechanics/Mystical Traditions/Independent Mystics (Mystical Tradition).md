Particularly gifted individuals have always been able to bend and break seemingly inescapable laws of nature, and many scholars claim that it was through coalitions of such independent, or untamed, mystics that the traditions first arose. Whether this is true or not, there occasionally are individuals who either choose or are forced to study on their own, or in smaller groups. Independent Mystics are not burdened with the theories of the traditions, which give them more freedom in their choice of powers. However, they are also much more vulnerable to Corruption. Many untamed mystics tend to evolve their own under standing of the world and come to espouse theories that contradict those of the established traditions.

### Powers
The player may pick any mystical power for his or her independent mystic.

### Rituals
Independent mystics rarely learn rituals, but when they do the chosen rituals tend to be highly personal, without regard for traditional restrictions.

### Corruption
The gift of freedom is double-edged and darkness is drawn to the gifted as envy to those with talent. The power of Corruption cuts deep and must be kept under control; many a free mystic has accepted the darkness although it truly is a kiss of death.
