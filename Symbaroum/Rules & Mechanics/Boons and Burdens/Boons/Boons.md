Boons are skills or resources which are effective for handling social challenges and problem-solving situations, instead of being useful in combat. Anyone can acquire a boon, it is most often a question of practice. However, since the various boons occur naturally in different environments, they are still chiefly relevant for the members of certain occupations and archetypes, at least at the start. It should also be added that the boons listed in this section are great for adding color to the character, for a lower cost in Experience than abilities.
Some of the boons may be purchased multiple times, meaning that its bonus can be from +1 to +3. These are marked with a * in the list on page 52, and it is also mentioned in the description of the boons in question.
