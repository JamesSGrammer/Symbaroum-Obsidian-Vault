Wherever it moves, the creature spreads the cold of the grave around itself like an aura, and everyone in its immediate vicinity is at risk of being affected.

---
- **I Free.** The creature spreads the paralyzing cold of the grave; player characters within melee distance are paralyzed, should they fail a Resolute test. One test is made each turn, and should the test be successful, the character can act as normal. Once a character has withstood the cold of the grave it cannot be affected again during the same scene. 
- **II Free.** As I, but with the addition that the cold is harmful, dealing 2 points of damage per turn to those affected, ignoring Armor. 
- **III Free.** As II, but the cold now affects characters who fail a [Resolute‚ÜêResolute] test.
