When the creature dies, its accumulated wrath is unleashed in attacks against those unlucky enough to be within reach. From level II, the Death Struggle attacks count as normal combat actions and can make use of active abilities, powers and traits.

- I **Action**: *Reaction*. The creatureâ€™s death struggle lets it perform a free attack against an enemy within melee range, as a reaction to the attack that killed it. 
- II **Action**: *Reaction*. As I, but the attack is performed like a normal combat action.
- III **Action**: *Reaction*. As II, but the creature may attack up to five enemies that it can reach without moving.
