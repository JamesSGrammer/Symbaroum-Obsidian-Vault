- Adept **Active**. The mystic can ensnare a Chain of creatures. If the mystic manages to ensnare a target with a successful Resolute test, then he or she can attempt to snare another one, and so on until an attempt fails. Start ing the following turn, a [Resolute←Strong] test is made for each target to determine how many of them remain ensnared.
