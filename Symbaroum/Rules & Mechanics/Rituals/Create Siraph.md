**Traditions**: Sorcery

This ritual is performed on a newborn child, who then undergoes both physical and mental changes. Physically, it acquires the Shapeshifter trait, and the mystic may lock its appearance for a long time; the effect begins to wear off after 10+1d4 years. The ritual also weakens the child's vitality. For spring elves, this means that they will never reach the next stage of their elven life cycle, while humans would have their lifespan shortened to 30+1d10 years. As for the mental changes, a mystical link is established between the siraph and the mystic, who can later use it to take control of his/her creation. The victim of the ritual is not aware of this link, not even when it is activated. Technically, Create Siraph works the same way as the Possess ritual, except that it requires no [Resolute‚ÜêResolute] test. Another difference is that the victim remains under the mystic's control indefinitely, so long as the mysticallows the host enough rest. There is no protection against such a brutal ritual as Create Siraph. Each time the ritual is performed, the mystic suffers one (1) point of permanent corruption, and each time mystics take control of their creations, they suffer 1d4 temporary corruption, regardless of traditions or other forms of protection.
