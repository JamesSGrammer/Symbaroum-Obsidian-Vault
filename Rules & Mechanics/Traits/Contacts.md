The character has served in an organization or traveled far and wide, and has therefore spun a wide web of contacts. With a successful roll against [[Persuasive]], the character can call to mind a contact that should be able to help with a specific question or in a precarious situation. The contact may not be available directly – that depends on who is included in the web of contacts. Suitable factions and people when it comes to specifying the character’s con tacts are: the Queen’s Army, the Queen’s Rangers, Witches, Ordo Magica, the Church of Prios, the Noble Houses and Treasure Hunters.
