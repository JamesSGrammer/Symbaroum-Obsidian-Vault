The tower of Ordo Magica is, besides the Beacon, the tallest building in Thistle Hold. Reaching seven stories high it stands on a plot surrounded by a stone wall, a plot where the novices of Master Cornelio grow and study various herbs salvaged from the forest. A short time ago they discovered the flammable oil than can be extracted from the damdra-seed – something which has resulted in large-scale, troubled excavations on the turf of the lindworm Skaramagos.
Officially it is the Master of the Chapter, Cornelio, who runs local affairs. But there are always other masters at the tower and sometimes the arguments between them echo far across the rooftops. The greatest conflict seems to be the one between the Chapter Master and the two other permanent masters in Thistle Hold, Goncai and Eufrynd. The fact that the latter two have been observed cuddling in a stall at the Salons of Symbaroum is hardly to the advantage of Cornelio. In fact, it may eventually lead to a change from the Chapter’s current caution to more bold strategies of exploration.
