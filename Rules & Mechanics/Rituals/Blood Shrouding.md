**Tradition**: Sorcery

The mystic flays a dead person and dresses in its skin, one sliver at a time. After that, the mystic looks exactly like the dead person but has his own voice and his own eyes, which limits its uses. To trick an individual who was acquainted to the diseased and who talks to the mystic, a test against [Discreet←Vigilant] must be made. The effect lasts for 24 hours, then the dead skin falls off.
