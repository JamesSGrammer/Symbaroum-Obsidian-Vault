The creature has no fixed shape, adapting its form to its surroundings and the challenges it faces. The effect lasts until the creature opts to switch traits or it is targeted by the mystical power True Form â€“ if successful, this removes the traits provided by the Metamorphosis, until a new active action is spent on getting them back.
Through the process of adapting itself, the creature can take on a form giving it characteristics that correspond to one or more of the following traits: [[Acidic Attack]], Amphibian, [[Armored]], Carapace, Deadly Breath, Diminutive, Grappling Tongue, [[Natural Weapon]], [[Poisonous]], [[Poison Spit]], [[Prehensile Claws]], [[HomeBrew/Ruins of Symbaroum/Rules & Mechanics/Monstrous Traits/Robust|Robust]], [[Tunneler]], [[Web]], [[Wings]].
