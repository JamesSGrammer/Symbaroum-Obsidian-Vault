Tradition: Theurgy 
The mystic lets pacifying light flow through chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents the shackled person from using mystical powers and traits that require a Resolute test. The light evaporates from the shackles over time, so the effect must be maintained by a renewed ritual each month.
