**Tradition**: Witchcraft
All physical traces of the mystic and his or her allies disappear. For instance, footsteps in mud subside, broken branches and grass stalks heal and spider webs are mystically restored. The ritual works just as well in civilization; dust settles on mosaic floors and piles of paper are arranged as they were before the mystic or some ally browsed them.
The duration is 24 hours, either forward or back from the casting of the ritual; traces from the previous dayâ€™s activities can be obliterated, or the effect can affect all activities performed during the day after the ritual is performed. In any case, the effect of the ritual is that neither the mystic nor his or her allies can be traced by any physical means, including smell. Mystical tracking methods are not affected.
