Mechanical traps come in many designs, but the basic version consists of two jagged semi-circles that slam shut when triggered. A passed [Strong←Cunning] test is required to get free, the latter being the trap-makers attribute value (the average trap-maker can be assumed to have *[[Cunning]]* 13 (–3)). Each attempt to break free counts as a combat action. 
**Weak**: The trap deals 1d8 damage.
**Moderate**: The trap deals 1d10 damage.
**Strong**: The trap deals 1d12 damage.
