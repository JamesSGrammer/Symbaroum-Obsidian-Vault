The missile battery is a siege weapon unsuitable for use by anyone but trained sappers. It consists of a wooden frame into which hundreds of alchemical missiles can be loaded. When ignited, the burning, screeching missiles rain down on the enemy troops. Every creature caught in the rain of missiles must pass a *Defense* test or get hit by a flaming arrow. If hit, the target rolls again, until a *Defense* test succeeds â€“ then he or she is not hit by any additional arrows.
