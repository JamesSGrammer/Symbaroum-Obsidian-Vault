Some sorcerers and cultists have through exposure to dark powers developed a capacity to endure corruption and to attract corruption that would have affected others. With practice, Channeling may also be used for passing corruption on to others, as a brutal weapon.

---
- Novice **Reaction**. The character can choose to receive temporary corruption that will otherwise affect someone else within sight.
- Adept **Reaction**. The character gets a second chance when rolling for corruption and in situations when receiving corruption for someone else. The character may accept the higher or lower outcome depending on what is more favorable; combined with the master level in Channeling the higher out come is better, in all other cases the lower outcome is preferable.
- Master **Reaction**. The character can pass corruption on to someone else; this is true for all forms of corruption he or she suffers, no matter the source. With a successful [Resolute‚ÜêResolute] test, corruption suffered is transferred to a target in sight. If the test fails, the master still only suffers half of the corruption (rounded up), while the rest leaks out into the surrounding area, making plants wither and the ground darken.
