The character is trained to cheat in games and knows how to avoid detection. He or she gets a +1 bonus on Cunning tests when gambling, and to get away with it the cheat must pass a [Discreet←Vigilant] test versus the opponent with the highest Vigilant, a test that the cheat gets a second chance to succeed on. Cheat can be combined with Gambler for additional bonuses. Cheat can be acquired multiple times, up to a maximum bonus of +3 on relevant tests.
