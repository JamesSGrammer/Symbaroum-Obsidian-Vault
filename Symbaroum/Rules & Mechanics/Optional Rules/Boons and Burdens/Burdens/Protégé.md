The character has to put up with and protect a protégé. The protégé can be a beloved child, an elderly but respected mentor, a soulmate or just an annoying relative whose welfare is connected to a future inheritance for the character. Either way, this person is played by the Game Master and tends to get into trouble. The protégé has no stats besides those associated with weak resistance, and gains no Experience from adventuring –he or she is as much a burden over time, as at the start.
If the protégé dies or goes missing, the character is afflicted by other problems; sorrow and remorse, mirrored in a suitable burden. If the character pro tected the person from love, burdens like Addiction or Nightmares can be appropriate. And if the protection was related to personal gains, maybe Wanted or Arch Enemy is better – the relatives of the protégé do not easily forget the characters betrayal.
