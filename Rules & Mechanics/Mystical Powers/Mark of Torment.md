**Tradition**: Symbolism
Cryptic patterns cause severe stomach pain that reduces the victim's mobility and concentration, and can even inflict physical damage.

---
- Novice **Active**. The symbol triggers a chain of twinging pains; the victim closest to the symbol suffers first [Resolute‚ÜêResolute]; if the victim is affected, a new test is made for the next enemy, and so on until someone can resist the energies. The effect lasts one turn and prevents the victims from performing any active actions.
- Adept **Active**. Like Novice, but the pain is so sharp that the victims get two chances to fail at all reactive actions (such as Defense).
- Master **Active**. Like Adept, but now the pain is so severe that it has physical consequences, dealing 1D6 damage to Toughness (ignores Armor).
