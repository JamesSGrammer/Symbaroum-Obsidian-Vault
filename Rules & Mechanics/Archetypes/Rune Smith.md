Among the trolls there are warriors who have sworn a holy oath to only fight with weapons of their own making, dressed in armor crafted by their own massive hands. These rune smiths count among the most skilled craftsmen of the Underworld and are fierce warriors. It seems ogres are also drawn to the fire of creation, just as elves appreciate the art of the forge, the hammer often held by abducted humans.
In Ambria, there are strong blacksmith traditions but even if blacksmiths are often seen wielding their own weapons, most of them lack the dedication the trolls show on the battlefield. However, lately the old secrets have begun spreading to Ambria, lifting its blacksmiths to new heights.
