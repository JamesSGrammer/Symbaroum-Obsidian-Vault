**Tradition**: Sorcery

It is said that knowledge of this ritual was first given to pact-making mystics from daemons who themselves could not, or did not want to, travel through the space between worlds. And it seems plausible, considering how dangerous it is for humans to visit the Yonderworld, even when they know what to expectâ€¦ As usual, the ritual takes an hour to perform, but to do so successfully the mystic must either have visited the destination or possess an object taken from there. In the latter case, it could be an urn of dust or a more personal gift from an allied daemon. As for the former, one can for example use the mystical power Teleport to identify a (for the moment) safe landing site. The ritual must be repeated when the mystic (and the up to [Resolute/2] individuals who can be brought along on the journey) wants to return. In other words, the travelers are stuck in the Yonderworld for at least an hour, which explains why so few dimension walkers ever return. In the Yonderworld much can happen in the time it takes to perform a ritual; the Game Master decides what the player characters are faced with, or makes a roll on Table 5 every half hour.
