**Tradition**: Staff Magic, Troll Singing 
**Material**: A melee weapon 
By willpower alone, the mystic makes a weapon soar and fight, with the speed and agility of a thought. The weapon in question does not have to be spe cial in any way; if it has qualities or powers, these may be used by the mystic according to standard rules of combat. However, the mystic cannot use other abilities related to melee combat while using this power.

---
- Novice **Active**. The mystic lets a weapon dance and uses Resolute instead of both Accurate (attack) and Quick (defense). Other than that, normal combat rules apply. The novice must focus on the weapon while fighting, which prevents him or her from using other powers or abilities while the weapon dances.
- Adept **Active**. The mystic must take control of the weapon by spending a combat action to activate the power, but then the weapon fights on its own while the mystic is free to use other powers and abilities. Both attack and defense rolls are made against Resolute.
- Master **Free**. The weapon dances out of the scabbard when the master needs it, attacks once per turn and defends the character by itself, leaving the mystic free to use other powers and abilities. Both attack and defense rolls are made against Resolute.
