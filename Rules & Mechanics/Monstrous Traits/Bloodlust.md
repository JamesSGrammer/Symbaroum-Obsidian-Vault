The creature thirsts for warm blood, and with its gaze it can put its victim into a trance before feasting on its life-giving juices.

---
- I **Action**: *Active*. The creature may charm [Resolu te←Resolute] and bite its victim in a single Com bat Action. The bloodsucker then slurps blood, 2 Toughness per turn, ignoring armor. It takes a [Resolute←Resolute] each turn to maintain the trance. Damaging the bloodsucking creature can also break the trance, [Resolute –Damage]. 
- II **Action**: *Active*. As I, but the bloodsucking creature also heals as much Toughness as it draws from the victim. 
- III **Action**: *Active*. As II, but damage and healing is 3 Toughness per turn. Also, the victim itself cannot break the trance; someone else has to attack and damage the bloodsucker for the control to be lost, [Resolute –Damage].
