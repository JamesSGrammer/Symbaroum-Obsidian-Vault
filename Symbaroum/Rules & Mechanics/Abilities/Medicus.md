The character is schooled in the art of healing and therefore a greatly coveted asset in its society, whether he or she keeps diseases from spreading, takes care of wounded warriors or tends to the ruling elite. The art of healing has been developed in parallel with alchemy, and many healers are also trained in alchemy for this reason, especially those who operate far from civilization where there are no herbal cures to buy from well-stocked merchants. A character with the Medicus ability can diagnose and cure diseases and identify a poison by its symptoms. Medicus also gives the character a coroner’s point of view, which might come in handy when examining a crime scene or a dead body.
