The character has a trusty friend in the form of a jakaar or mare cat â€“ any beast will do, so long as it poses weak resistance. The pet is unswerv ingly loyal to the player character. In combat and problem-solving it is played by the player as a second character, but it does not gain Experience and cannot develop its stats (for that you need the ritual Familiar). If the pet dies, the character can have it replaced at the start of the next adventure.
