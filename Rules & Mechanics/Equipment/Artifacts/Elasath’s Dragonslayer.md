In the early years of Symbaroum, when dragons still hunted its people and livestock, King Eoran-Ald Ornon ordered his mystics to forge a weapon worthy of his greatest dragonslayer, Elasath. The warrior princess gratefully accepted the gift and went to work. Some tales claim that she killed twenty-seven grown dragons before falling victim to the fire of Fofar the Destroyer. No one remembers, or cares, how many of her fellow hunters were also killed.

Elasath’s Dragonslayer is a spear with the qualities [[Balanced]], [[Blood-letting]], [[Deep Impact]], and [[Long]], as well as the mystical quality [[Bane Weapon]] (reptiles). In addition, the following powers can be activated:

**Shatter Armor**: When attacking a reptile, the artifact’s master can choose to strike with the flat side of the spearhead and (if it hits) produce a shock wave which ripples through the victim’s scaled skin. The attack does not deal any damage, but causes most of the scales to fall off. The scales will eventually grow back, but for one month, the creature’s natural Armor is reduced to 1. 
**Action**: Active 
**Corruption**: 1D4

**Break the Serpent’s Charm**: As a free action, the master can brandish the spear in a way that generates an awful, jarring sound. The noise instantly cancels the paralysis which comes from the monstrous trait Enthrall, and affects everyone who hears it. However, nothing stops the freed individuals from being enthralled all over again. 
**Action**: Free 
**Corruption**: 1D4
