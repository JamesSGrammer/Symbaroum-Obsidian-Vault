As a collective, the merchants are the most power ful faction in Thistle Hold, and among them the antique dealers comprise the elite. Consequently, intrigues equal to those found among the nobles in Yndaros are found in and around the marketplaces in the Hold.
When it is rumored that a successful expedition is on its way back to town, it all breaks loose. Merchants do their best to gain an advantage, resorting to anything from smearing opponents to robbing them blind; at times even kidnappings or murders take place. And for the happy one who manages to secure the vending rights the troubles are far from over, as rivals will do everything in their power to sabotage sales.
