Some theurgs regard themselves as herdsmen of the people, as missionaries and healers. These Confessors primarily work to enforce that which is good, keeping the flickering light of Prios alive by providing it with fuel. They are often found in leading positions, within or outside the church, in order to reach as many people as possible when working to spread light and truth. Many of the highest leaders and greatest theurgs in the church of Prios wander the road of the Confessor.
