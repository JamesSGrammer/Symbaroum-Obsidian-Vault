The character is past its prime and has both good and bad days. If the first success test of the day is a success, it is a good day and everything seems to be alright; if the first test of the day is a failure, it is a bad day – the gout sets in, all joints are aching or the character is out of breath even when seated. Whatever the cause, the character has –1 on all tests for the day.
