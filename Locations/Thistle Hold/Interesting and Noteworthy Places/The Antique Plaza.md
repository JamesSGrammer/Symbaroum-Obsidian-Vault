What happens in the Antique Plaza at the center of town is determined by the ebb and flood caused by the varied success of treasure-hunters and explorers. The stalls and booths are of course always there, and so are the potential and very eager buyers from Yndaros and the noble houses. But sometimes the latter cannot do much else but sip hot beverages at the plaza’s famous tea-houses or examine the ancient bronze well – a remnant of old Symbaroum that in fact is the reason why Thistle Hold is located where it is.
Everything changes when one or two expeditions return from the wilds. Usually it takes a couple of days before the treasures reach the plaza, since a select crowd of potential buyers always get the opportunity to inspect the items first. But when that happens the whole block is turned upside down: food and drinks are served from every window; the sound of voices arguing about prices combines with the cacophony of bards trying to outperform each other and the cries from victims of muggers. Only inside the Treasury and Faraldo’s Novelty Store – the establishments that most often are awarded the privilege of selling the finest antiques – does a relative calm prevails as the auctions proceed.
