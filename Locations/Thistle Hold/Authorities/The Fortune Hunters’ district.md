A long list of famous and successful fortune hunters live in the district east of Thistle Street, south of Lasifor’s Road, in peace and quiet between expeditions. Many have also retired and devote them selves to helping younger talents, for a substantial provision of course. He who is offered a place under Iasogoi Brigo’s or Lysindra Goldengrasp’s wings also gets access to all their contacts and, in some cases, part of their fortunes. And even if all help comes at the expense of required return in the form of future shares, this can be exactly what a group of newly baked explorers need to fulfill their dreams. On the other hand, the district also inspires nightmares. Some of its residents – among others Elmea Rabbit’s Foot and the terrifying elder who was called Erok the Dark at his prime – never leave their estates. It is talked about blight-marks and even worse; that many of the district’s success stories have a soot black and corruption corroded flipside. If so, that could possibly explain the cries of torment that sometimes echo through the southeastern parts of town, maybe also the beastly howls that the residents of the district usually blame on their tame jakaars.
