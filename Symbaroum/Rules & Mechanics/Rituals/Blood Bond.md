**Tradition**: Witchcraft 
The corrupting effect of magic is of course well known to mystics. Sometimes the Corruption is a necessary price to pay in order to succeed with whatever task the mystic has undertaken. In the same way, the tainting of a familiar can be a necessary sacrifice for the mystic to be able to continue serving its people or its calling.
By using this bond of blood, the mystic can share Corruption with its familiar. The mystic has to make a Resolute test whenever a Blood Bond ritual is attempted. A successfully performed ritual decreases the mysticâ€™s permanent Corruption by 1D4 points, and increases the familiars permanent Corruption by 1D6. The familiar suffers all the usual signs of corruption. Should the familiar turn into an abomination the mystic loses control and is immediately attacked by its former companion.
The ritual costs one (1) Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. The mystic cannot perform the ritual for someone else
