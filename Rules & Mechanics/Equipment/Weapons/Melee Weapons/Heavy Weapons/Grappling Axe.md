This long-shafted axe is a bastard weapon used during assaults. It can be held one-handed, together with a shield, or alone when climbing ladders to the battlement where it is gripped in both hands to clear the top of the wall. Older models from The Great War were used in sea battles and have a grappling hook on the back of the axe head, in order to secure safe passage from one ship to another.
