**Tradition**: Theurgy
**Material**: A holy symbol. 
By faith and will, the mystic raises a holy shield against the weapons of its enemies. The shield is invisible until attacked, at which time it glitters as if struck by sunlight.

- Novice **Active**. With a successful roll against Resolute the mystic surrounds itself with a warm glow. This glow provides an addi tional 1D4 Armor. Also, any abomination or undead who attacks the mystic with melee attacks suffers 1D4 damage from the glow, ignoring Armor. The blessed shield lasts until the end of the scene.
- Adept **Active**. As at the novice level, but the extra Armor and the damage dealt is rolled with 1D6. Also, an ally within sight can be included in the effect of the blessed shield.
- Master **Active**. As at the novice level, but the extra Armor and the damage dealt is rolled with 1D8. Two of the mysticâ€™s allies can be included in the effect of the blessed shield.
