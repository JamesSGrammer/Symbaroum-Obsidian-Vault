In close proximity to the Antique Plaza is a building which has acidified the relations between Mayor Nightpitch and the ruling body of the Sun Church, the Curia – namely the missionary station of the highborn sun priest Father Sarvola. The elderly liturg has long been notorious within the Church for calling its practices crude, heartless and condemning. He says that: “Just like the sun generously shines upon high and low, wretched and pious, so shall our Church treat all children of Prios with the same warmth and love.” Since coming into an enormous inheritance a couple of years ago he has used his newly acquired wealth to spread this message of love and compassion – a message that persuades a slowly increasing number of newly ordained priests to help him in the tasks of running the soup-kitchen in Blackmoor and proselytizing both there and among the Karabbadokks
The fact that Mayor Nightpitch allows Sarvola to run his heretic movement in town is highly dis approved of by literalist theurgs and Black Cloaks, especially by father Elfeno, the head of the local sun temple. But the Mayor argues that so long as you pay your dues and refrain from inciting riots anyone is welcome to stay. However, there are many indications that the agents of the Church will take matters into their own hands. New malicious rumors about Sarvola surface on a daily basis and his sermons are often disrupted by boos and seemingly spontaneous outbursts in the audience.
