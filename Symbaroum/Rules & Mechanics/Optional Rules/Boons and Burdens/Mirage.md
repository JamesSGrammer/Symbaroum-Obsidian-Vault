The person has a mystical gift and may weave momentary mirages from thin air; flames that emit no heat jump between his or her hands, tiny figures of light dance in the air, and so on. The character can also weave false images over smaller objects, for instance making pebbles appear as shining coins. Over time, the mirage will not fool anyone as its effect wears off at the end of the scene. With Mirage, the person may roll against Persuasive to dupe someone into accepting fake goods or payment in the form of illusory coins, to a maximum “value” of a hundred thaler. Also, Mirage grants +1 to Persuasive when the player character threatens someone with “powerful magic.”
