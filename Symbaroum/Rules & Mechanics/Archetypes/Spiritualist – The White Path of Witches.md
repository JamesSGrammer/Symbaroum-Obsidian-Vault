Witches who solely walk the path of Spiritualists are uncommon and often marked by their journeys through the nothingness, where cold winds blow and the dead wail. They are often pale of both skin and shadow, cold to the touch and hollow-eyed with a gaze that can pierce shadows and souls. Since contact with the dead is debilitating and dangerous, Spiritualists are respected and sometimes feared even by other witches; their Death Divinations are as remarkable as the wisdom they glean from the Spirit World.
