According to the Curia, the governing body of the Sun Church, Father Sarvola is a heretic spreading false doctrines and dragging the sublime name of Prios in the dung of the gutters. The problem is that very few others seem to worry about the doings of the apostate. 
On the contrary, many silently approve of his missionary activities among goblin scum and barbarians, as well as his appeals for generosity, love and brotherhood. In short: so long as the Queen, Lasifor Nightpitch, Grand Master Seldonio and other influential individuals accept the activities of Sarvola, there is not much the Curia can do. At least not in the open.
