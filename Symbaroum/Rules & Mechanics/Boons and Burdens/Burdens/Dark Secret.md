The character has some kind of dark secret, which threatens to destroy his or her reputation and life if revealed. Maybe the character has been a member of a corrupted cult, killed someone, or protected a murderer and never gotten caught. Should the dark secret become publicly known, the character gets one of the burdens Pariah or Wanted instead, depending on the secret. Once per adventure there is a risk for exposure; the character must roll a Discreet test during each adventure, a test with a sec ond chance to succeed. If failed, someone discovers a clue which can lead to the truth. Maybe some kind of physical evidence surfaces (a letter, for instance)? Is it a witness claiming to have seen something or is the character talking in his sleep? Whether the suspicious person is a non-player character or a character, the one with the dark secret must lay their curiosity to rest or suffer the consequences. Note that a non-player character may want to extort, rather than expose, the character.
