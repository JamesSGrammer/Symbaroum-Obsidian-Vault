**Tradition**: Theurgy
The mystic anoints him- or herself with holy oils before a battle, thereby gaining the following: +10 temporary Toughness, +1d4 in protection in addition to any Armor worn, and +1d4 damage on all attacks. If the mystic is damaged, he or she first loses the temporary Toughness, before his or her own Toughness is affected.
The downside is that the mystic cannot be healed and that all death tests automatically fail during the scene. The effect lasts for the duration of a scene.
