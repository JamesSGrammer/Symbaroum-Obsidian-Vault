The creature can strike terror into the heart of one or more creatures. Terrify requires that the creature has the monstrous trait Spirit Form.

- **I Active.** The creature’s gaze forces a single victim to make a [Resolute←Resolute] test, or automatically spend both of its actions backing away. If the victim cannot back away, it will defend itself in desperation, but cannot compel itself to attack. The victim may make a test each turn, trying to shrug off the fear. 
- **II Active.** The creature’s horrific shriek forces every one that is nearby to make a [Resolute←Resolute] test, or automatically spend both of their actions backing away. If the victims cannot back away, they will defend themselves in desperation, but cannot compel themselves to attack. The victims may make a test each turn, trying to shrug off the fear.
- **III Free.** As II, but the victims do not defend them selves against attacks, fleeing if possible, cowering in place if not. The victims may make a test each turn in order to shrug off the paralyzing fear.
