The Powers of Wizardry come from disciplined studies into the fundamental laws of nature, and from insights regarding how these laws can be used and controlled by sheer will and reason. It is a strenuous education, even without the boring every day tasks that the novices must perform for their masters. Only half of those who begin their studies with Ordo Magica see them through, but those who prevail are rewarded with a deep understanding of the mysteries of wizardry.
	Wizardry grew out of early forms of theurgy, in a time when the people of Alberetor
still worshipped a pantheon of gods. Philosophers and scholars started to renounce the metaphysical ideas of the priesthood, instead regarding the laws of nature as independent from the machinations of deities. To the founders of Wizardry, the Old Gods were seen as the creators of the world, but not its shepherds. Instead the world is regarded as being profoundly magical and not in need of any Gods to function. Nor is the world meant to be worshiped, merely understood – and used.

### The Titles of Ordo Magica
The titles of Wizardry are closely linked to the competence and function, as well as the status, of the individual. The list of a novice’s duties is a long one, and the commitments of the adept wizard are considerable, though their new title comes with a touch of authority and privilege. An adept who is experienced enough to teach carries the title Magistrate.
	The Masters often have a specific area of expertise, and the few obligations they
have can usually be delegated to a novice or adept under their rule. Each order chapter (commonly called “Wizards’ guild”) is governed by a Chapter Master, who represents Ordo Magica when dealing with local authorities. Ordo Magica as a whole is headed by the Grand Master, stationed at the chapter in Agrella.
	The title of Arch Mage is no longer in use. Before The Great War the Grand Master
 of the organization was chosen from within the circle of Arch Mages. But since all Arch Mages perished in the war, the Grand Master is instead chosen by, and often from among, the acting Chapter Masters.

### Corruption
According to Ordo Magica, Corruption is largely misunderstood, thanks to the sermons of hot-headed theurgs and the fairy tales of witches. It all comes down to a regulated response; a reaction that appears when a mystic uses his or her power to affect nature. This is not that different from what happens when someone jumps off the stern of a boat, simultaneously pushing the boat forward with the same amount of force that goes into the jump. If the jumper is reckless, he will drop into the water; if the jumper is careful, he will land on the dock with dry shoes.
