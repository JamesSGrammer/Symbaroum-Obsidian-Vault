**Tradition**: Only available to Staff Mages 
**Material**: A rune staff
In the hands of a staff mage, the rune staff is a powerful throwing weapon. The staff is thrown at an enemy and returns to the mysticâ€™s hand, whether it hits or not.

---
- Novice **Active**. The mystic throws the staff and may roll against Resolute instead of Accurate to hit the target. The staff deals 1D8 damage; the effect of a possibly activated elemental rune (see Staff Magic) is added.
- Adept **Active**. Like novice, but the projectile deals 1D10 damage. The staff may be thrown past blocking terrain or enemies to reach a tar get further away; the mystic does not need a clear line of sight but has to see at least part of the target. The effect of a possibly activated elemental rune (see Staff Magic) is added.
- Master **Active**. The staff is thrown in a chain and the mystic may use Resolute instead of Accurate to hit. The first hit deals 1D12, the second 1D10, the third 1D8, the forth 1D6 and the fifth 1D4. The chain is not broken by missing an attack test, but the damage is reduced with each target, hit or no hit. More than five targets cannot be targeted by the Staff Projectile; the mystic must see the tar get but does not need a clear line of sight. The effect of a possibly activated elemental rune (see Staff Magic) is added.
