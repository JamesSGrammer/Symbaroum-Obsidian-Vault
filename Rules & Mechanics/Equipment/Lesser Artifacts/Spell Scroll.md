Artifact crafters in Ordo Magica can bind a mystical power at the novice, adept or master level (depending on the level of the artifact) to a scroll. The power may then be activated by someone else who has [[Wizardry]] at a level equal to or higher than the level of the power, or someone who has the ability [[Loremaster]] at adept level. Whoever activates the scroll suffers temporary corruption as usual and the scroll is spent upon activation.
