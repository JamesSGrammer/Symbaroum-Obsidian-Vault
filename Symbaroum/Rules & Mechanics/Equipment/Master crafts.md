During their adventures, the player characters may happen upon master crafted weapons and armor, and should they instead find valuables or coin they have the opportunity to buy master crafts from especially skilled blacksmiths.
The master smith has the ability to add one or more qualities to the object in question, or alternatively remove negative qualities. For every added or removed quality, the cost/value of the item is cumulatively increased by x5. If a sword costs five thaler, a master craft version with the quality Deep Impact would be worth 25 thaler. And if you also want that sword to be Precise, the value is ramped up to 125 thaler. Costly for sure but maybe worth it, since this fine master craft gives +1 on both damage and chance to hit.
