Many sorcerers foster cults around themselves and their beliefs, promising drug-induced insights and black salvation to those willing to follow the mystic into the dark. Not many defect from such cults and those who do and survive more than a few days are fewer still, hunted as they are by both the cult they left behind and by witchhunters and black cloaks. The situation is not made any easier by the defector’s own burdens – memories of services rendered to please their master and explicitly cruel actions performed in the name of the cult weigh most former cultists down and haunt their nightmares long after leaving the Master.
Some former cultists were once deeply convinced fanatics, while for others the membership was more of a practical choice motivated by ambition or greed. However, if one is to believe the interrogation protocols of the black cloaks, desperation is the most common characteristic among cultists – the injustices of life combined with a charismatic leader who promises redemption and strength can be an attractive combination. But no matter the background, the choices of the cultist were never innocent; the hands of the former cultist are forever colored by blood.
