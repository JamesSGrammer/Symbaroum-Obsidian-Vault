As a weapon, the hammer is ancient and its brutal simplicity may in the right hands pound forth a deadly rhythm echoing over the battlefield. The character is one of those who, through training and experience, can utilize the force of the hammer, whether in its single-handed or heavy version.

- Novice **Reaction**. The character can crush the enemy’s shield with the hammer. After a failed attack roll where the opponent defends with a shield (that is, the enemy parries the character’s attack), the character may roll a [Strong←Quick]. If successful, a wooden shield shatters to splinters while a metal shield is torn from the opponent’s arm and dropped. The shield carrier also suffers 1D6 damage from the heavy blow.
- Adept **Reaction**. When an enemy successfully de fends against a hammer attack, the character can grip the shaft of the hammer with both hands and use it to ram the enemy. A passed [Strong←Strong] test drives the opponent one step backwards, and in the space that opens up, the adept hammer fighter gets to make a Free Attack against the enemy.
- Master **Active**. The character makes two hammer attacks against the same target, in one action. If the victim successfully defends against any of these, the master may perform a hammer ram as described at the adept level. Only one ramming per turn is allowed, even if the opponent defends against both attacks.
