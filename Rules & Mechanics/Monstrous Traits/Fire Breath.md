The creature has the ability to breathe fire, so hot that it can burn the enemy to cinders or at least give them serious burn wounds.

---
- I Active. The creature aims its fire breath at a single target. If successfully passing a [Accurate←Quick] test, the puff deals 6 in damage. If failed, the da mage is 3.
- II Active. The creature keeps the fire breath ongoing. If successful with a [Accurate←Quick] test, the puff deals 6 in damage; if failed, the damage is 3. If the target takes full damage, the creature may try to direct the flaming fire towards another target, and so on until the creature fails its [Accurate← Quick] test.
- III Active. The creature exhales a storm of fire. If successful with a [Accurate←Quick] test, the puff deals 6 in damage; if failed, the damage is 3. The chain continues even if the creature fails the test once; it is broken at the second failed test against [Accurate←Quick].
