Alchemical mines are crafted by an alchemist who possesses the ability Trapper and/or Pyrotechnics. When triggered, they spray flammable substances over the wretched targets and deal fire damage for a number of turns. To scrape off the flammables requires a combat action and a passed [Quick←Cunning] test, the latter being the mine-maker’s attribute value (the average alchemist can be assumed to have *[[Cunning]]* 13 (–3)). An alternative is to dive into water, which smothers the fire for as long as you stay there. Allies trying to help the burning target may make separate tests in order to scrape off the substances.
**Weak**: The explosion deals 1d8 damage, after which the substance keeps burning for 1d4 turns, dealing 1d4 damage per turn.
**Moderate**: The explosion deals 1d10 damage, after which the substance keeps burning for 1d6 turns, dealing 1d6 damage per turn.
**Strong**: The explosion deals 1d12 damage, after which the substance keeps burning during 1d8 turns, dealing 1d8 damage per turn.
