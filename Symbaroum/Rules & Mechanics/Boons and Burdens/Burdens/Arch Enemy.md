The character has, by actions or name, made an arch enemy. This individual has devoted his or her existence to destroying – and in the end, taking – the character’s life. At least once during each adventure, the influence of the arch enemy will show. He or she primarily acts through others; hiring thugs or spreading lies in the hope that others will make life difficult for the character. Exactly who this arch enemy is, why he or she hates the character and what resources are at hand, is for the player and Game Master to decide. However, it cannot be someone who is easily avoided or stopped from acting out his or her hatred.
