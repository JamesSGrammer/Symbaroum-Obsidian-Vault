When the former treasure-hunter Mehira lost her left arm, her right eye and the major part of her respiratory capacity in an encounter with a group of tricklestings she put the adventurer outfit on a shelf and settled down in Thistle Hold. But just like her former colleague, Mayor Nightpitch, she was unable to rest on her laurels. It did not take long before she had a new business up and running, one which proved to be both lucrative and beneficial to the ambitions of the Queen.
Any fortune-hunter may register at the agency, relating his or her personal details along with a description of important skills and the willingness to take risks (low, high, extreme, foolish). The skills are sorted under the categories a) Fighter, b) Pathfinder and c) Mystic, and must upon enrollment be verified in some way. Once the agent has received a first assignment, the contractors get to evaluate his performance; evaluations are used to rank the agents. The price you must pay to hire an agent is then based on his or her rank, the supposed timeframe of the contract and its estimated level of risk. A quarter of the cost and a fixed deposit are awarded Mother Mehira, the rest is paid to the agent once the job is done.
