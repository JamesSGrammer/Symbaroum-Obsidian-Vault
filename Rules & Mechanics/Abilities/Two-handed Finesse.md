Most people fighting with a two-handed weapon rely on its considerable weight, but there are also those who cultivate the ability to wield huge two-handed swords with great finesse. Those who possess this ability belong to that category, and can use the length of the weapon to combat all sorts of opponents.

- Novice **Passive**. In the hands of the novice, two-handed swords gain the quality Long and can therefore be used with the Polearm Mastery ability.
- Adept **Reaction**. After one successful Defense per turn, pass a [Strong←Strong] test to push enemies out of melee combat with the sword. The enemy takes 1D6 damage, is pushed back a couple of meters, and must once again face the quality Long.
- Master **Active**. The master's flowing strikes count as a chain of attacks against enemies within melee distance – if an enemy is hit, an attack is made against the next one, and so on until an attack fails.
