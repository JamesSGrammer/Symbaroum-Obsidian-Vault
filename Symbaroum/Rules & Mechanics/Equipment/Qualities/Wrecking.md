The weapon is primarily meant to attack buildings, rather than living creatures; its lack of precision makes it all but impossible to aim at individual enemies, leaving it better suited for shots at fortifications or large areas on the battlefield . Its effect on buildings is considerable and multiple hits will likely wreck the structure â€“ a tower collapses, a wall is breached, a gate is blown open to give the attackers a chance to storm the building.
Creatures who happen to be where a Wrecking weapon hits take damage; *Armor* is ignored but a passed *Defense* test halves the damage. Anyone present in or on a building which is destroyed dies or becomes dying if they fail a Defense test; if the test is passed, he or she suffers damage instead, ignoring *Armor*. Furthermore, the individual is buried in the rubble and it takes the rest of the scene to get out of the wreckage.
