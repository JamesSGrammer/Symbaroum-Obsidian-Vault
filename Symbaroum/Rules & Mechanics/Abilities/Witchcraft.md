From the deep soils and wild spirits of Davokar comes the tradition of witchcraft. For generations, its teachings have been passed on to witches who, alongside the chieftains, have led the people of the forests through mishaps and triumphs alike. Surely, it is the primal powers of witchcraft that enables the barbarian clans to live within Davokar.
