- Novice **Full turn**. The character gets lost in a short trance. With a passed Resolute test, it gains access to the novice level of an optional ability, **Mystical Traditions, Ritualist and Mystical Power excluded**. The ability can be used for the rest of the scene, before fading from memory.
- Adept **Active**. The characterâ€™s closer connection to the collective memory makes the trance even shorter; other than that it works like the novice level.
- Master **Active**. The character can dig deeper into the collective memory. With a passed Resolute test, it gains access to the adept level of an optional ability, **Mystical Traditions, Ritualist and Mystical Power excluded**. The ability can be used for the rest of the scene, before fading from memory.
