**Tradition**: Troll Singing 
The mystic can restore a damaged item by singing â€“ a broken sword is mended, a shattered vase is reassembled and a corroded lock regains its functionality. The restored item recovers all its functions and qualities. The mystic cannot create anything new by using the ritual.
