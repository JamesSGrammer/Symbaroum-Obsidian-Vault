The creature has been gifted with the ability to perceive its surroundings using sound waves â€“ it emits sound pulses that bounce off nearby objects and return to the creature, which then forms a mental image of what its surroundings look like. Because of this, the creature can perceive beings and objects made invisible by powers or traits, and in other respects act as usual even in complete darkness.
