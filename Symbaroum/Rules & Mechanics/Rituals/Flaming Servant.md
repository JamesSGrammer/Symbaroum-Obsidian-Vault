Tradition: Wizardry
The mystic awakens a fierce fire creature and binds it to a suit of metal (medium or heavy armor). The servant then walks by the mysticâ€™s side like a smoldering and steaming bodyguard, which flares up and turns into a burning warrior in battle. The mystic can only have one Flaming Servant bound to itself at any time, and if the Flaming Servant perishes in battle, then the suit of armor needs to be repaired by a blacksmith in order for the ritual to be placed on that same armor again.
The Flaming Servant is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains Experience as a player character and loses it if it dies, just like a character.
