Tormented by memories of confrontations with the hordes of the Dark Lords, Pellio accompanied the first detachment to abandon the south. He took part in the short siege of the village of Kadizar and was thereafter commanded to patrol its walls. In order to scatter his thoughts he started playing dice and soon he owed a small fortune to persons who would rather make use of his skills than demand reimbursements. Pellio became an expert at handling all sorts of shady deals – from extortion and exactions, to smuggling, to outright acts of violence.
Three years ago the fifty-year-old veteran resigned from the army and moved to Thistle Hold where he applied for a position in the town watch. The controlled environment is more or less made for a man of Pellio’s talents. He is careful not to get involved in anything too risky, but no one has safer smuggle routes in and out of the Hold than he and no one has him beat when it comes to procuring sensitive objects or substances. If you need anything done in Thistle Hold, turn to Pellio!
