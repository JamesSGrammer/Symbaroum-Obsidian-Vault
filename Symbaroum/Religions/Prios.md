The sun god and the One true god worshipped by the Ambrians people.

Today Prios is recognized as the Giver of Laws or as the One, and almost all Ambrians adhere to His commandments, as conveyed by the priests and theurges of the Sun Church. Prios is said to be everywhere beneath the heavens and humans are tasked with cultivating His creation. Sadly, man has neglected this duty for a long time, which in turn means that Prios has lost much of His strength, so much in fact that He is dying. But according to the sermons there is still hope. If humans strive to correct the error of their ways – if they work harder, extract more crops from the soil, harvest more and richer resources from the forests and mountains, colonize more of the wilds – then Prios will grow strong again.

In the quest to honor and strengthen the Sun God, Davokar has a vital role to play. The wild, unruly forest is considered to be the perfect example of what happens when humans refrain from doing what they are obliged to do. Davokar must be cleansed, its potency disciplined and its resources cultivated. It is to advance that quest that the Curia, the high council of the Sun Church, sends missionaries as well as explorers into the depths of Davokar, and why they have already established a temple on Karvosti, the age-old Thingstead of the barbarian clans.
