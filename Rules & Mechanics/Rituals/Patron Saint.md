Tradition: Theurgy
The mystic is accompanied by a guardian spirit, the soul of a fallen Templar given the honorable mission to once again serve one of the Sun Godâ€™s chosen. The martyr manifests as a warrior of light that normally is invisible but starts to shine when danger is close, and protects its ward until its second death. Only one Patron Saint can be bound to a mystic at a time, and should the saint be defeated in any way a new one must be summoned. A Patron Saint is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains Experience like a player character and loses it if it dies, just like a character.
