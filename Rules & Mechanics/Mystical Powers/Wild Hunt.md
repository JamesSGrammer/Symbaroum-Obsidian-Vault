**Tradition**: Only available to Blood Waders 
**Material**: The fur of a beast dead from natural causes
Davokarâ€™s nature may seem dark and full of con flicts, trapped in an eternal cycle of birth, strife and death. But to mystics who have the capability to see the deeper truth, there is a perfect imbalance to this cycle; a higher form of harmony. This insight can be used by the mystic to acquire the help of seemingly hostile creatures of the Beast category.
The summoned beasts may not be of the same type as the enemies; otherwise the type is decided by which types occur naturally in the environment. The character dictates how the beasts act during the scene, after which they turn and leave the area.
