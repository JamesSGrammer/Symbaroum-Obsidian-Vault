Many young nobles fantasize about Yndaros and the court, but not all of them. One of those who would rather seek adventure than intrigues is Vallomei Derego, the fourth son of baron Valtos. Like other noble youngsters he has more riches than judgment and a mouth bigger than his courage, which is why he has spent the better part of three years talking about and preparing for the perfect expedition. Equipment has been bought, a cartographer has helped him to draw a map and the archives at Mother Mehira’s agency have been scrutinized for the perfect band of companions.
The target of his planned journey is of course Symbar; he wants to become famous for being the one who found a safe passage to the legendary palace of the last Symbarian emperor. Everything is set for departure, except for one last detail: the choice of an escort. Vallomei has such low regard for “common people” that he has a hard time finding someone he can trust. But as soon as that happens, as soon as he comes across a group of persons that makes him feel at ease, the trip towards the beating heart of Davokar will commence.
