The character stems from a culture that by tradition does not use writing, but which instead has developed memory techniques to preserve and transmit vital knowledge. He or she remembers everything seen or heard, which means that the player may ask the Game Master about details perceived by the player character during its past adventures. The Game Master must answer as thoroughly as possible.
