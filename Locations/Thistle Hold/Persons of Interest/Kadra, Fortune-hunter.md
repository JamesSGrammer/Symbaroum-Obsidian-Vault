No more than fourteen years of age, the orphaned Kadra arrived at Yndaros in a caravan filled with refugees. In the luggage she had nothing but traumatic memories: the death of her parents, her uncle’s guardianship, the defiance of her big brother Julio which led to his death and to Kadra being thrown out into loneliness and poverty. All alone in the Promised Land she really had to struggle to survive, first as a servant in the capital, later as a maid on the estate of the House Argona.
At the estate she met other young boys and girls dreaming of freedom and riches. They visited the inn at Argona Village, listened to stories about the treasures of Davokar and eventually they decided to give it a go. Out of the group who started the journey towards, and later on down into, Jerak’s Sinkhole, only a badly bruised Kadra made it back. Luckily she did so with a bag full of precious artifacts salvaged from the ruins in the deep. Since then two years have passed and Kadra still gets by on what she earned from selling the finds, waiting for the right people to cross her path – capable adventurers who can accompany her back to Jerak and who are willing to let her keep at least half of the loot.
