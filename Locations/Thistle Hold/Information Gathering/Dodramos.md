- Location: Tent in Blackmoor

He calls himself Dodramos, the soothsayer who for the last four years has lived in a tent in the western part of Blackmoor. Judging by his sweeping mannerisms, toothless doomsday predictions and love for sweets he is nothing more than a swindler. Nevertheless, presently there have been sightings suggesting the opposite: Dodramos has been visited or picked up by particularly well built, if not extravagant, wagons. It is rumored that several noble houses have started seeking his advice, also that celebrities like Chapter Master Cornelio and Mayor Nightpitch have paid for his services. Other rumors say that Dodramos was a practicing theurg at the monastery of the Twilight Friars before he turned up in Blackmoor (after having lost or recovered his senses, depending on the story). This is strongly denied by the Sun Church, and, since Dodramos himself seems to enjoy the mystery surrounding his person, the commoners are left to speculate. The residents of Blackmoor say that Dodramos is an oracle for hire, but that he would just as soon be paid in food or hugs as in shillings. Most of them do not put much faith in the predictions, which remarkably often foretell a bright and prosperous future for any and all. Sure, such prophesies can be enough to provide the poor and broken inhabitants of the tent camp with a glimmer of hope, but it hardly affects his credibility in a positive way.
