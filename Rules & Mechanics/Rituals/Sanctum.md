Tradition: Wizardry The mystic can use this ritual to cover a loca tion (one large or a couple of smaller rooms) in a magical shroud, making it impossible to peek inside or disturb it from outside with mystical powers. Sanctum blocks the effect of rituals like Clairvoyance, Summoning or HereticÂ´s Trail, but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the Sanctum.
If there is a Magic Circle within an area affected by Sanctum (regardless of which was there first), then no one but the mystic who performed the Sanctum can use the circle for communication or for the purpose of performing a Seven-league Stride.
