The throwing wing is designed so that a skilled user can make it return to the place from which it was thrown, if it misses its target (requires a passed Accurate test, made as a Free Action). In the depths of Davokar, throwing wings made from hardened wood are used to hunt small game, while the ones used in combat have a knife-sharp edge of steel all around the wing.
