In two neighboring houses on a back street close to the Toad’s Square lays The Slaughterhouse. One is the actual slaughterhouse, the other a tavern that can take about a hundred guests at the long tables. The menu mainly consists of offal – heart, liver, stuffed lung and various pasty stews. It is cheap but not the least distasteful, and if you are prepared to pay more there is newly butchered fine meats to order, slow cooked or sautéed in sun-yellow butter. Were it not for the vile rumors circulating, the owner of the Slaughterhouse, Master Morlam, would have even more guests at his tables. He mutters that it is his competitors who claim that some of the meat he is serving is waste from the Abomitorium – not only mare cats, jakaars and wild boars but also goblins, ogres and a few barbarians. But as long as the proud Master Butcher refuses to comment on such claims the rumor mill will likely continue to grind, not least since they are based on a fair question: what happens to the remains of the creatures killed during fights in the arena?

Where ever the waste of the Abomitorium goes, master Morlam at the Slaughterhouse does not know. But that does not mean that the rumors regarding his establishment are unfounded. Morlam asserts that no meat should go to waste and has kept to a belief that was far from uncommon when the Ambrians arrived north of the Titans: namely that goblin meat will do just fine for making beef sauces and stews. Furthermore, the meat of fairies is a real delicacy, especially if the specimens are properly fed prior to slaughter. As for meat from humans, he would never accept having such ingredients under the knife – that would of course be barbaric! Everyone knows that Morlam gladly pays for deceased goblins and spring elves, but it is a well kept secret that he is after more than their glands for peddling them to the alchemists in town. Another secret is the elf cage in the basement below his home and the two unscrupulous hunters he sometimes hires to hunt goblins when the stock is about to run out. Then again, worst of all is probably that he, out of greed, tends to ignore blight-marks found on some of the forest beasts he butchers. To eat such meats is unwholesome, to say the least …
