**Material**: A drop of pure water
The wellspring of life runs clear and refreshing in these dark days. Dedicated healers can draw from its power and transform it into a purifying gift that cleanses souls of corruption and heals physical wounds.

- Novice **Active**. The mystic washes away 1D4 points of temporary corruption from a creature in sight. Any excess points heal the creatureâ€™s Toughness instead. The mystic may use this power on him- or herself.
- Adept **Active**. The mystic washes away 1D4 points of temporary corruption from himself and all allies in sight. Any excess points heal Toughness instead.
- Master **Reaction**. The mere presence of the Confessor directly reduces the harmful effect of temporary corruption on all allies in sight. When an ally uses a mystical power or an artifact that gives corruption, the amount suffered is reduced by 1D4 points. Any excess points have no effect. In this case, the power has no effect on the mystic using it; the player character suffers from temporary corruption when using powers and artifacts as usual
