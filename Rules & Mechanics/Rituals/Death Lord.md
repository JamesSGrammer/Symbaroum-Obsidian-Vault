**Tradition**: Only available to Necromancers 
The higher level of the ritual [[Raise Undead]] lets the necromancer summon an undead creature of greater power, a Death Lord; a blackened skeleton in soot-covered full plate armor, that performs the mysticâ€™s bidding with eyes that burn from behind the visor. Death Lords are smart and take their own initiative when solving problems; they often command hordes of lesser undead or act as the bodyguards of their makers. The Death Lord is handled like a second character, and gains Experience and is developed just like a player character.
