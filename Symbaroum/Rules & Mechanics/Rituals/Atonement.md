**Tradition**: Only available to Confessors
The higher level of the ritual Exorcism makes the theurg able to lighten the spiritual burdens of a non-possessed person; this is done by the sinner accepting to perform a task for the Confessor. The task must be time-consuming and expensive or dangerous, usually some good deed for the Sun Church or for Prios in general. Once the task is accomplished, the sinnerâ€™s permanent corruption is reduced by 1d4. The ritual costs one point of Experience to perform, paid by the confessor or the sinner (the mystic decides).
