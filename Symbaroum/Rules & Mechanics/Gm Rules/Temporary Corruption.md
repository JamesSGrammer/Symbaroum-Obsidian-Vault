Temporary Corruption is a momentary expression of the world’s reluctance to be subdued and controlled. It fades away by itself at the end of the scene but is still dangerous, since it can push a character’s Total Corruption over its Corruption Threshold (Blight marked), or past double its Corruption Threshold, turning the character into a blight beast.

### Actions that give temporary Corruption:
◆ Using a mystic power or ritual: 1D4 temporary Corruption 
◆ Using tainted artifacts: varies, but mostly 1D4 temporary Corruption 
◆ Damage from certain abominations 
◆ The dark areas of Davokar: The darker areas of Davokar are dangerous; the corruption varies from 1D4 temporary Corruption each day to 1D6 temporary Corruption each hour. It is said that the corruption suffered within the darkest parts of the forest is permanent.
