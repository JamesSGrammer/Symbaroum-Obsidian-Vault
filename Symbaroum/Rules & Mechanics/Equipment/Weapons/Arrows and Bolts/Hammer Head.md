The ball-shaped head of this arrow is meant to stun, rather than damage, the target. After a successful hit, damage is rolled as usual, but the outcome is used to decide if the target is stunned [Strong â€“Damage]. If the target is stunned, he or she may not perform any kind of actions in the following turn.
