Tradition: Witchcraft
The mystic alters the local weather as he or she sees fit. Fog that obscures oneâ€™s view, storms that prevent trips or the calming of such storms are all possible to achieve. The ritual takes one hour to perform and the effect remains active for half a day; after that the local weather returns to its natural form.
