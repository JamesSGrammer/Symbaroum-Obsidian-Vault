The Ambrians are capable and experienced when it comes to waging wars, but they are also characterized by a profound spirituality and an aptitude for refined skills and nuanced knowledge. They are a people bent on conquest and ownership; they always strive for more and better, whatever it concerns. Nature is regarded as a resource, filled with supplies which can make life more comfort able, or in any case more tolerable, and many Ambrians would willingly risk life and limb in the hope of finding treasure, knowledge or rare goods which could secure them a comfortable future.
