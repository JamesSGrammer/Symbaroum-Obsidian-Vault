Social challenges consist of important negotiations, often involving the great and powerful personas, groups and monsters of the game world â€“ situations that are unfit for combat and cannot be solved with a mere Persuasive test. In short, the social challenge is solved by your and your friends' roleplaying, where you will have to persuade, deceive and bargain your way to a solution. The Game Master handles the parameters for the social challenge, while you portray your character and together with your fellow players try to carry through a successful negotiation around the gaming table.
Social challenges are often preceded by scenes of problem-solving, where the character gathers information, secrets and rumors that can be used against the one they need to persuade.
