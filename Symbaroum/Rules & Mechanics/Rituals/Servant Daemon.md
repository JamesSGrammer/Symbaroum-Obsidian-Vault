**Tradition**: Only available to Demonologists 
The higher level of the ritual [[Summon Daemon]] binds a servant daemon to the demonologist. The servant is weak at first but can develop over time, and it is handled by the player like a second character. Also, the Servant Daemon can be the subject of the ritual [[Blood Bond]].
