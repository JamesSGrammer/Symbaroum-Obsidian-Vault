The creatureâ€™s blood is corrosive, and sprays all around when the creature is hit by attacks. Whoever hits the creature in melee combat, and manages to damage it, must make a Defense test or be hit by the acidic blood. Removing the acid from either body or armor requires that someone spends an Action and makes a successful Cunning test (wash it away with water, dirt, sand or some thing similar).
