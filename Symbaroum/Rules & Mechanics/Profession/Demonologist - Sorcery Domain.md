Beyond the world – or between worlds, if one believes in the existence of multiple worlds – lays the Yonderworld. In the Yonderworld soul-eating creatures roam, indistinguishable from abominations to the common man. Sorcerers appreciate the likeness, but call them “daemons” in acknowledgement of their differing origins. The daemons can be forced, lured or invited into the physical world by those who know of passages between the worlds. These passages may also be used by demonologists to temporarily flee the world – or for casting enemies out of the world, where they might end up face to face with a soul-eating daemon.
