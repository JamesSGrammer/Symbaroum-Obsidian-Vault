**Price**: 2 [[Thaler]]
A wax candle that when lit makes living creatures (not undead or abominations) glow softly in the dark, making it harder to stay hidden (a second chance to fail tests for sneaking up on someone, or a second chance to pass tests to discover someone sneaking). This affects everyone in the room or the vicinity, including the one who lit the candle.
