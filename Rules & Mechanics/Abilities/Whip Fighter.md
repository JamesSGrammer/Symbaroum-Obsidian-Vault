It is not uncommon for witch hunters and black cloaks to fight with a sword in one hand and a whip in the other. This is an effective and deadly combination; in the hands of someone with the proper training, it can even bring down well armored opponents.

---
- Novice **Active**. Attack with a whip in one hand and a one-handed weapon in the other. If the whip attack hits, the character gets a Free Attack with the one-handed weapon, regardless of whether or not the whip deals damage.
- Adept **Active**. As Novice, but the whip hinders the enemy's movements so that the Free Attack hits automatically.
- Master **Active**. As Adept, but the whip fighter pulls the enemy toward himself/herself so that the Free Attack also deals +1D6 damage.
