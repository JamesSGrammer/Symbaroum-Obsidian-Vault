The Spirit World is the outer realm of the world, where the dead journey towards their final rest â€“if they are not disturbed by a necromancer on the way. Necromancers can force the spirits of the outer realm to return, in order to relay their secrets or to occupy a dead body and serve the death mage as a dragoul or some other undead being. An understanding of the mechanics of death also gives the necromancer access to ghastly powers and rituals.
