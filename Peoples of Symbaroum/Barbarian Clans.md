The barbarian clans have lived in greater harmony since the arrival of the Ambrians. It is thought that the clan folk are descendants of Symbaroum, the civilization that ruled the region up until a millennia ago. There are differences between the clans in terms of lifestyle and customs, but in the end they have much in common. What they share is probably best symbolized by the witches, the spiritual leaders of the clans and advisors to the chieftains. Under the guidance of the witches, the barbarians are fully aware that they are living in and dependent upon nature for their safety and survival. And they have all borne witness to what happens when one does not respect the taboos dictated by the Huldra, the head of all witches who lives on Karvosti alongside the High Chieftain.
