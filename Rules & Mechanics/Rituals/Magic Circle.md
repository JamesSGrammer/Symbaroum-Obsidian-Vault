**Tradition**: Wizardry 
The mystic establishes a permanent magical circle which can be used to communicate telepathically with persons in other known magical circles. Only mystics with the Magic Circle ritual can initiate telepathic communication with another circle, but anyone can receive such a transmission. The mystic needs not have visited these other circles to be able to communicate with them, but must know with certainty that there is another circle at a specific location to be able to reach it. There must also be a person in the receiving circle for communication to be possible. All who stand within a receiving Magic Circle are aware of and may participate in the communication; one cannot discriminate between recipients.
