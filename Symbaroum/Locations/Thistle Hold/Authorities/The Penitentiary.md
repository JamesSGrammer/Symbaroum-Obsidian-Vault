There is no great need for prison cells in Thistle Hold, since most criminals are either condemned into exile or directly to death. But none the less, there is a small and closely guarded building at the Garrison which is commonly called the Penitentiary. There the most serious offenders in town are held captive pending Law Enforcer Asmerda’s verdict, and it is there troublemakers and drunkards from the dives around the Toad’s Square are dragged to sleep it off. Visiting the Penitentiary is far from pleasant, especially during the winter when the icy cold creeps along the floors of the unheated building. There are no bunks, the food consists of water and bark bread, and you are seldom told for how long you will have to stay. However, the biggest fear comes from somewhere else. The warden is the weasel-like Pergalo, the son of the master torturer Katia who managed to make a captured Dark Lord reveal where Queen Korinthia was held prisoner, near the end of The Great War. The stories told of what Pergalo does to knocked-out drunkards during the nights are enough to deter most people from drinking too much. And woe to the suspected conspirator, spy or dark-minded cultist who ends up in the murky cellar vaults of the Penitentiary!
